For many Bitcoin holders, one question remains: how can I move my assets across
blockchains to make them more useful while maintaining Bitcoin's core values?

Existing solutions that bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum require users to send their
Bitcoin to an intermediary in exchange for an Ethereum token that represents the
original asset. This centralized model requires you to trust a third party and
is prone to censorship, threatening Bitcoin's promise of secure, permissionless
decentralization.

Threshold aims to solve this problem with TBTC v2.

The second generation of TBTC is a truly decentralized bridge between Bitcoin
and Ethereum. It provides Bitcoin holders permissionless access to DeFi and the
expanding web3 universe.

TBTC v2 replaces centralized intermediaries with a randomly selected group of
node operators on the Threshold Network. This group of independent operators
works together to secure your deposited Bitcoin through threshold cryptography.
That means TBTC v2 requires a majority threshold agreement before operators
perform any action with your Bitcoin. By rotating the selection of operators,
TBTC v2 protects against any malicious individual or group of operators seizing
control. Unlike other solutions on the market, users on TBTC v2 are reliant on
math, not hardware or people. Additionally, TBTC v2 is open and accessible to
anyone.
  
TBTC v2 allows anyone to use Bitcoin in the expanding DeFi and Web3 universe
without a third-party intermediary.

== Overview
tBTCv2 uses the
link:https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/tree/main/solidity/random-beacon[Random
Beacon] and link:https://github.com/keep-network/sortition-pools[Sortition Pool]
to generate governable-sized (starting at 51-of-100)
link:https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/114.pdf[threshold ECDSA]
Bitcoin wallets at a governable frequency (starting weekly). The youngest
wallet accepts new deposits, and the oldest wallet serves redemptions.

Depositing Bitcoin into the tBTCv2 bridge grants a transferable Bank balance, which
can be used to mint a supply-pegged ERC-20: TBTC. For an in-depth explanation
about the design, see link:docs/rfc/rfc-1.adoc[RFC 1: tBTCv2 Design].

== Installation

=== Prerequisites
* clone the repository
* link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] v14.21.2
* yarn: `$ npm install -g yarn`
* configure git to use https

```
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
```

  https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac[suggested] to use
  `pyenv` to manage multiple Python versions.
```
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.11.1
```
