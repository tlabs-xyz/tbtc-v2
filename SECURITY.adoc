== Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please email the contact listed at https://keep.network/security.txt
and include:

- The affected component (**client**, **Solidity contracts**, or **protocol**).
- A text description of the vulnerability.
- Preferably, code to reproduce the issue (unless it is a protocol issue).
- If available, an initial assessment of impact, ideally using the
  https://www.first.org/cvss/[Common Vulnerability Scoring System]. There is
  a https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1[calculator] to help. Note that
  for CVSS purposes, the Keep team generally treats fund compromise as a loss
  of Confidentiality.
- If desired, a suggestion on how to fix the issue.
- If reporting a sensitive vulnerability in an encrypted message, please
  include a key for encrypting replies, or a secure medium to contact you.
  Note that for various reasons, the Keep team prefers email and Keybase, but
  can work with Signal and Telegram on a case-by-case basis. Please always file
  an initial report via email, even if follow-up is handled via a different
  channel.

Please also note the suggestions on email structure below, and prefer to
encrypt particularly sensitive vulnerabilities with one of the keys listed at
https://keep.network/security.txt .

=== Timelines

The Keep team will make a best effort to respond to a new report **within 48
hours**. This response may be a simple acknowledgement that the report was
received, or may be an initial assessment from the team. Unless the report
is assessed as irrelevant or incorrect, this response will include expected
next steps and communication time frames from the Keep team.

=== Assessments

The Keep team will try to make an initial assessment of a bug's relevance,
severity, and exploitability, and communicate this back to the reporter.

=== Email structure

For simplicity, we recommend a standard flow for the vulnerability report:

```
SUMMARY

A summary of the issue.

SAMPLE EXPLOIT STEPS

A series of steps that can be used to exploit this vulnerability.

IMPACT (optional)

If available, an initial assessment of impact. Usage of the
https://www.first.org/cvss/[Common Vulnerability Scoring System] is
encouraged. There is a https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1[calculator]
to help. Note that for CVSS purposes, we generally treat fund compromise as a
loss of Confidentiality.

DETAILS

A detailed description of the vulnerability, including any information that
can be used to better understand and/or reproduce the vulnerability.
Preferably include code to reproduce.

SUGGESTED REMEDIATION (optional)

If desired, a suggestion on how to fix the issue.

FOLLOWUP INFO (optional)

If this is an encrypted message, include your PGP key for an encrypted reponse.
Alternatively, you can include a Keybase handle,  Signal number, or a Telegram
handle (in order of the Keep team's preference).
```

=== Email subject

To help in filtering reports, please use an email subject in this format, omitting
severity if you are not certain of impact:

```
[SEVERITY] [component] issue: [brief summary]
```

Subject: [8.6 HIGH] Solidity contracts issue: Incorrect handling of
         Bitcoin addresses can lead to deposit redemption failure

Body:

SUMMARY

Funding transactions that use p2pkh are accepted during funding but can be used
to trigger ECDSA fraud during redemption.

SAMPLE EXPLOIT STEPS

Eve creates a deposit, funds it using a P2PKH or P2SH output, and requests
redemption. The signing group is unable to provide a redemption proof, and
eventually Eve seizes the group's bonds.

IMPACT

We consider this an 8.6 on the CVSS 3.1 scoring scale, as it can compromise
signer funds, and can lead to signer fund loss that is value-positive for the
attacker. Attacker profit is ~50% the value of the funds they are willing to
put into the attack, while per-signer loss is ~12.5% of the funds the
attacker puts into the attack.

CVSS 3.1 vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N/CR:M

DETAILS

When providing a funding proof, three types of outputs are accepted: P2WPKH,
P2PKH, and P2SH outputs. The system is designed to handle the first and fails
for the second and third.

If a P2PKH output is provided, the signing group is able to generate a scriptSig
which can spend the output. However, that will trigger the ECDSA fraud flow as
the signature wasn't authorized.

If a P2SH output is provided, then the public key of the keep will be interpreted
as a script. This most likely results in a locked output.

SUGGESTED REMEDIATION

Disallow P2PKH and P2SH outputs when providing funding proofs.
