# tBTC V1.1 Account Control System Specification

**Version**: 1.1  
**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Implementation**: Complete  
**Purpose**: Authoritative technical specification for the complete V1.1 Account Control system

---

## Executive Summary

The tBTC V1.1 Account Control system implements **configurable M-of-N consensus** for critical operations while allowing **90% of watchdog operations** to remain independent. The architecture achieves security and efficiency through targeted application of consensus mechanisms only where authority is required.

### Core Principle
**Independent operations for data, consensus for authority, automatic responses for emergencies.**

The system consists of three main components:
- **QC Management System**: Qualified Custodian lifecycle and operations
- **Watchdog Consensus System**: M-of-N voting for critical authority decisions  
- **Protocol Integration**: Direct Bank/Vault integration for efficient operations

## Contract Architecture

### 1. Watchdog System

#### WatchdogConsensusManager.sol
**Purpose**: M-of-N consensus for critical operations requiring group authority

**Key Features**:
- Configurable M-of-N voting (default: 2-of-5, bounds: 2-7)
- Four operation types requiring consensus
- 2-hour voting window with automatic expiration
- Proposal auto-execution when threshold reached

**Operations Requiring Consensus**:
1. **STATUS_CHANGE** - QC status modifications (Active ↔ UnderReview ↔ Revoked)
2. **WALLET_DEREGISTRATION** - Remove wallet from QC (prevents griefing)
3. **REDEMPTION_DEFAULT** - Flag redemption as defaulted (triggers penalties)
4. **FORCE_INTERVENTION** - Manual override operations (emergency governance)

**Parameters**:
```solidity
uint256 public requiredVotes = 2;      // M (required votes)
uint256 public totalWatchdogs = 5;     // N (total watchdog count)
uint256 public votingPeriod = 2 hours; // Voting window
```

**Bounds**:
```solidity
uint256 public constant MIN_REQUIRED_VOTES = 2;
uint256 public constant MAX_REQUIRED_VOTES = 7;
uint256 public constant MIN_VOTING_PERIOD = 1 hours;
uint256 public constant MAX_VOTING_PERIOD = 24 hours;
```

#### WatchdogMonitor.sol
**Purpose**: Coordinates multiple independent SingleWatchdog instances and emergency responses

**Key Features**:
- Watchdog instance registration and lifecycle management
- Emergency circuit breaker (3 critical reports → automatic pause)

- Clean separation between monitoring and consensus

**Emergency System**:
```solidity
uint256 public constant CRITICAL_REPORTS_THRESHOLD = 3;
uint256 public constant REPORT_VALIDITY_PERIOD = 1 hours;
```

## Operation Classification

### Category 1: Independent Operations (90%)
**Authority Source**: None needed (data submission) or cryptographic proof

| Operation | Implementation | Why Independent |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Reserve Attestations | SingleWatchdog | Multiple views welcome |
| Wallet Registration | SingleWatchdog | SPV proof is authority |
| Redemption Fulfillment | SingleWatchdog | Bitcoin proof is binary |
| Concern Reporting | SingleWatchdog | More perspectives = better |

### Category 2: Consensus Operations (10%)
**Authority Source**: M-of-N group decision

| Operation | Implementation | Why Consensus |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| QC Status Changes | WatchdogConsensusManager | Authority to change operational status |
| Wallet Deregistration | WatchdogConsensusManager | Authority to remove capabilities |
| Redemption Default Flagging | WatchdogConsensusManager | Authority to impose penalties |
| Force Interventions | WatchdogConsensusManager | Authority to override normal flow |

### Category 3: Emergency Operations (Automatic)
**Authority Source**: Threshold-based triggers

| Operation | Implementation | Trigger |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Emergency Pause | WatchdogMonitor | 3+ critical reports in 1 hour |
| Report Cleanup | WatchdogMonitor | Time-based expiration |
| Status Recovery | WatchdogMonitor | Manager override |

---

## Security Model

### Consensus Mechanism
- **M-of-N configurable voting** (default 2-of-5, bounds 2-7)
- **Authority-based operation classification** (only decisions need consensus)
- **2-hour voting period** with proposal expiration
- **Emergency circuit breaker** (automatic response to 3+ critical reports)

### Decentralization
- **Multiple independent SingleWatchdog instances** (different operators)
- **Geographic distribution** encouraged
- **Organizational independence** required
- **No shared infrastructure** dependencies

### Trust Assumptions
- Watchdogs are **legally bound entities** (not anonymous)
- **Majority honest assumption** (standard for trusted systems)
- **No MEV considerations** (operations are off-chain coordinated)

### Threat Model
**Protected Against**:
- Single malicious watchdog (M-of-N consensus)
- Coordination failures (independent operations)
- Emergency scenarios (automatic responses)
- Operator failures (watchdog deactivation)

**Assumptions**:
- Majority of watchdogs honest (standard assumption)
- Watchdogs are KYC'd legal entities (not anonymous)
- DAO governance acts in system interest

### Attack Vectors and Mitigations

**Single Watchdog Griefing**:
- Attack: Malicious status changes or false reports
- Mitigation: M-of-N consensus for authority operations

**Coordination Attacks**:
- Attack: Majority collusion for malicious operations
- Mitigation: Legal/reputation consequences, DAO oversight

**Emergency Response Abuse**:
- Attack: False critical reports to trigger emergency pause
- Mitigation: 3-report threshold, manager recovery, different operators

**Availability Attacks**:
- Attack: Watchdogs go offline to prevent consensus
- Mitigation: Configurable thresholds, watchdog replacement procedures

### Security Features
- **Focused codebase**: Minimal attack surface through targeted implementation
- **Clear governance model**: No backdoor mechanisms
- **Simple invariants**: Straightforward majority rule implementation
- **Auditable design**: Single, clear execution path for all operations

## Operational Procedures

### Normal Operations

**Independent Operations** (Most Common):
1. SingleWatchdog instances operate independently
2. No coordination required
3. Results aggregated for pattern analysis

**Consensus Operations** (Rare):
1. Any watchdog proposes operation via WatchdogConsensusManager
2. Other watchdogs vote within 2-hour window
3. Automatic execution when M votes reached

**Emergency Operations** (Critical):
1. Watchdog submits critical report via WatchdogMonitor
2. System tracks report count and freshness
3. Automatic emergency pause at 3-report threshold

### QC Operations
1. **Registration**: Bitcoin wallet registration with SPV proofs
2. **Minting**: Direct Bank integration for efficient operations
3. **Redemption**: Two-phase redemption with timeout handling
4. **Attestation**: Regular reserve balance attestations

### Maintenance Procedures

**Add New Watchdog**:
1. Operator deploys SingleWatchdog instance
2. Manager registers with WatchdogMonitor
3. Grant WATCHDOG_ROLE in WatchdogConsensusManager
4. Update consensus parameters if needed

**Remove Watchdog**:
1. Manager deactivates via WatchdogMonitor
2. Automatically revokes consensus roles
3. Update consensus parameters for new count

**Parameter Updates**:
1. DAO governance votes on changes
2. Manager executes via updateConsensusParams()
3. All changes bounded by safety limits

**Emergency Recovery**:
1. Manager can clear false emergency pauses
2. DAO can replace managers if compromised
3. Watchdog operators can be replaced independently
