## ðŸ”§ Production Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation

**1.1 Environment Setup**
```bash
# Deploy to testnet first
npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia --tags AccountControlWatchdog
npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia --tags AccountControlConfig
npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia --tags WatchdogOperators
```

**1.2 Validate Deployment**
```bash
# Verify contract addresses and configuration
npx hardhat console --network sepolia
> const consensus = await ethers.getContract("OptimisticWatchdogConsensus")
> const state = await consensus.getConsensusState()
> console.log("Active watchdogs:", state.activeWatchdogs)
```

### Phase 2: Production Deployment

**2.1 Mainnet Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to mainnet
npx hardhat deploy --network mainnet --tags AccountControlWatchdog
npx hardhat deploy --network mainnet --tags AccountControlConfig
npx hardhat deploy --network mainnet --tags WatchdogOperators
```

**2.2 Watchdog Configuration**
```bash
# Add production watchdog addresses
# Replace test addresses with production addresses
# Verify minimum 3 watchdogs are configured
```

### Phase 3: Monitoring Setup

**3.1 Event Monitoring**
- Configure monitoring for all consensus events
- Set up alerting for critical conditions
