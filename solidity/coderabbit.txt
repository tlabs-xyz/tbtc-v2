Remove redundant network check.

The network filtering logic is already implemented in the skip function (lines 32-37). This inline check is redundant and should be removed to avoid duplication and potential inconsistency.



Apply this diff to remove the redundant check:

-  // Only deploy for test networks
-  if (hre.network.name !== "hardhat" &&
-      hre.network.name !== "localhost" &&
-      hre.network.name !== "development") {

Extract event parsing logic.

The event parsing pattern is repeated multiple times with similar structure.



Create a helper function to reduce duplication:

const extractRedemptionId = async (tx: any, contract: any): Promise => {
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  const event = receipt?.logs.find(
    (log: any) =>
      contract.interface.parseLog(log)?.name === "RedemptionRequested"
  );
  if (!event) throw new Error("RedemptionRequested event not found");
  return contract.interface.parseLog(event)?.args.redemptionId;
};


Then replace the repeated code with:

-      const receipt = await tx.wait()
-      const event = receipt?.logs.find(
-        (log) =>
-          qcRedeemer.interface.parseLog(log as any)?.name ===
-          "RedemptionRequested"
-      )
-      redemptionId = qcRedeemer.interface.parseLog(event as any)?.args

Comment:
Add validation for AccountControl dependency.

The constructor validates all contract addresses but accountControl is set separately via setAccountControl. Since the contract relies heavily on AccountControl (used in minting functions), consider adding validation or initializing it in the constructor.



The current implementation allows the contract to be deployed without AccountControl, but minting functions will fail with a call to zero address. Consider either:
1. Adding _accountControl parameter to constructor with validation
2. Adding a check in minting functions to ensure accountControl != address(0)

Prompt for AI Agent:
In solidity/contracts/account-control/QCMinter.sol around lines 154 to 159, the constructor validates several dependency addresses but leaves accountControl unset (it’s configured later via setAccountControl), which can allow deployment without AccountControl and cause minting functions to call the zero address; fix by adding an _accountControl parameter to the constructor and validate require(_accountControl != address(0), "Invalid accountControl address") and assign it to accountControl, or if you prefer to keep setter-based initialization, add a require(accountControl != address(0), "accountControl not set") at the start of every public minting function to prevent calls when it’s missing—pick one approach and apply consistently (constructor injection preferred).

Eliminate code duplication between mint functions.

The validation logic in _requestMint and _requestMintHybrid is nearly identical (lines 227-295 vs 362-430). This violates DRY principles and increases maintenance burden.

Add access control and verify reentrancy test behavior.

Two concerns with the minting function:

1. Missing access control: Anyone can mint tokens, which could lead to unauthorized token creation.

Race condition risk in wallet deregistration.

The acknowledged race condition between obligation checking and deregistration could allow wallets to be deregistered while redemptions are pending, potentially breaking user commitments.

Transaction validation has several potential issues.

The validation logic has good coverage but contains some problematic checks:

1. Locktime validation may be too restrictive - Line 172 rejects transactions with locktime more than 1 day in the future, but locktime values can be block heights, not timestamps.
2. Version validation is overly restrictive - Lines 177-180 only allow versions 1-2, but Bitcoin transactions can have higher version numbers.
3. Missing input validation for transaction size calculation - Line 157 assumes fixed sizes that may not account for variable-length components.

Add bounds checking and testnet Bech32 support.

Two issues with the address routing logic:

1. Missing bounds check: Lines 42-45 access addr[0], addr[1], addr[2] without verifying addr.length >= 3 first (though the condition on line 42 does check this, it's better practice to be explicit).

2. Missing testnet support: The function only recognizes mainnet Bech32 addresses ("bc1") but not testnet addresses ("tb1").

Fix separator detection and add comprehensive validation.

The Bech32 decoding has several critical issues:

1. Wrong separator detection: The code finds the first '1' character, but Bech32 spec requires finding the last '1' character as the separator.

2. Insufficient validation: Missing validation for minimum/maximum address lengths and witness program constraints.

3. Limited witness version support: Only supports witness version 0, but the function should validate and reject unsupported versions explicitly.
