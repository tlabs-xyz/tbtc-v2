///         redemption operations.
///
///         Depositors send BTC funds to the most-recently-created-wallet of the
///         bridge using pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) which contains hashed
///         information about the depositorâ€™s minting Ethereum address. Then,
///         the depositor reveals their desired Ethereum minting address to the
///         Ethereum chain. The Bridge listens for these sorts of messages and
///         when it gets one, it checks the Bitcoin network to make sure the
///         funds line up. If they do, the off-chain wallet may decide to pick
///         this transaction for sweeping, and when the sweep operation is
///         confirmed on the Bitcoin network, the wallet informs the Bridge
///         about the sweep increasing appropriate balances in the Bank.
/// @dev Bridge is an upgradeable component of the Bank.
