# tBTC v2 Account Control System Architecture

**Document Version**: 3.0  
**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive technical architecture specification with simplified watchdog system

---

## Executive Summary

The tBTC v2 Account Control system enables Qualified Custodians (QCs) to mint tBTC against their Bitcoin reserves through direct Bank integration. The system implements a 5-state QC management model with renewable pause credits and automated escalation, providing network continuity during operational issues.

**Key Statistics**:
- **Core Contracts**: 12 (QC management + state control) + 3 (watchdog)
- **QC States**: 5-state linear model (Active → MintingPaused → Paused/UnderReview → Revoked)
- **Network Continuity**: 60% of states preserve redemption fulfillment
- **Trust Model**: Multi-attester consensus with watchdog auto-escalation
- **Architecture**: Direct Bank integration with modular policies
- **Gas Savings**: ~50% vs abstraction layer approach

This system enables **Qualified Custodians** (regulated institutional entities) to mint tBTC tokens against their Bitcoin reserves through **direct Bank integration**. The system implements a simplified watchdog architecture focusing on objective enforcement.

### Core Architectural Principles

1. **Two-Problem Framework**: 
   - **Oracle Problem**: Multi-attester consensus for objective facts (solved by ReserveOracle)
   - **Enforcement Problem**: Permissionless enforcement of objective violations (solved by WatchdogEnforcer with embedded reason codes)

2. **Direct Integration**: Leverage existing Bank/Vault infrastructure without abstraction layers (~50% gas savings vs proxy approaches)

3. **Trust Distribution**: No single points of failure, minimum 3 attesters for reserve consensus, permissionless enforcement of violations

4. **Machine Readability**: Standardized bytes32 reason codes (INSUFFICIENT_RESERVES, STALE_ATTESTATIONS, SUSTAINED_RESERVE_VIOLATION) for automated validation without human interpretation

5. **Modular Design**: Policy-driven contracts enable evolution without breaking core interfaces

6. **Data/Logic Separation**: Clear separation between storage (QCData) and business logic (QCManager)

7. **Future-Proof Interfaces**: Stable core contracts with upgradeable policy implementations

### Integration with Existing tBTC v2

The Account Control system deploys as an **independent contract suite** that integrates seamlessly with existing tBTC infrastructure:

```
User → QCMinter → BasicMintingPolicy → Bank → TBTCVault → tBTC Tokens
```

**Key Integration Points**:

- **Bank Authorization**: BasicMintingPolicy authorized via `authorizedBalanceIncreasers`
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Uses same Bank/Vault/Token contracts as regular Bridge
- **Perfect Fungibility**: QC-minted tBTC indistinguishable from Bridge-minted tBTC
- **Coexistence**: Regular Bridge operations continue unchanged

## Design Rationale

### Core Architectural Decisions

#### Why Direct Bank Integration?

**Decision**: Integrate directly with existing tBTC Bank/Vault infrastructure rather than creating abstraction layers.

**Rationale**:

- **Simplicity**: Eliminates unnecessary abstraction layers that add complexity
- **Proven Infrastructure**: Leverages battle-tested Bank/Vault architecture with known security properties
- **Gas Efficiency**: Direct integration reduces transaction costs by ~50% compared to layered approaches
- **Reduced Risk**: Fewer contracts in the critical path means fewer potential failure points
- **Perfect Fungibility**: QC-minted tBTC is indistinguishable from Bridge-minted tBTC

#### Why Simplified Watchdog System?

**Decision**: Focus on objective enforcement only, abandoning complex consensus mechanisms.

**Rationale**:

- **Operational Complexity vs. Theoretical Security**: Complex consensus mechanisms proved operationally burdensome with 90% of watchdog operations being routine
- **Gas Efficiency Requirements**: Complex voting mechanisms consumed excessive gas, creating poor user experience
- **Machine vs Human Interpretation**: Original design required machines to interpret human-readable proposals, which proved difficult to automate effectively
- **YAGNI Principle**: Many sophisticated features designed for theoretical edge cases were never needed in practice

#### Why Three-Layer Decision Framework?

**Decision**: Separate deterministic enforcement (90%), threshold consensus (9%), and governance arbitration (1%).

**Rationale**:

- **Layer 1 (Deterministic)**: 90%+ automation through objective rule enforcement for measurable violations
- **Layer 2 (Threshold)**: Human-supervised consensus only for subjective issues requiring multiple attestations
- **Layer 3 (Governance)**: Final arbitration reserved for truly complex decisions requiring DAO intervention
- **Efficiency Focus**: Most operations should be automated, with human intervention only when necessary

#### Why Machine-Readable Evidence System?

**Decision**: Use structured evidence with cryptographic verification instead of human-readable proposals.

**Rationale**:

- **Automation Enablement**: Structured data enables true machine processing and validation
- **Evidence Hash**: Cryptographic verification ensures evidence integrity without trusting intermediaries
- **IPFS URI Pattern**: Decentralized storage provides detailed evidence while keeping on-chain data minimal
- **Threshold Mechanisms**: Clear quantitative triggers (3+ reports within 24 hours) remove subjective interpretation

#### Why Multi-Attester Consensus for Reserves?

**Decision**: Require 3+ independent attestations with median calculation for reserve balances.

**Rationale**:

- **Single Point of Trust Elimination**: No single attester can manipulate reserve data
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating even with malicious or failed attesters
- **Objective Facts Only**: Reserve balances are objective, measurable facts suitable for consensus
- **Staleness Detection**: Time-based validation ensures data freshness without complex coordination

### Technical Constraints

**Contract Size Limits**: Ethereum contract size limits necessitate library patterns for modular functionality.

**Gas Optimization**: Storage layouts and function designs prioritize gas efficiency for institutional users performing frequent operations.

**Message Signing Simplicity**: Bitcoin message signature verification uses standard ECDSA recovery, eliminating complex proof validation infrastructure.

### Dual Bitcoin Verification Approach

The system uses **two different methods** for Bitcoin verification:

1. **Message Signatures**: For wallet registration (proving QC controls Bitcoin addresses)
   - ✅ 95%+ complexity reduction vs SPV
   - ✅ 60-80% gas savings
   - ✅ Direct on-chain verification

2. **SPV Proofs**: For redemption fulfillment (proving QC actually sent Bitcoin to users) 
   - Uses existing Bridge SPV infrastructure
   - Required to prove actual Bitcoin transactions occurred
   - Provides cryptographic proof of payment

**Testing Requirements**: Advanced mocking capabilities needed for comprehensive coverage across multiple blockchain interactions.

## Simplified Watchdog System

### Two-Problem Framework

**Core Principle**: Focus on objective enforcement - oracle consensus for facts, permissionless enforcement for violations.

The system separates concerns into:

- **Oracle Problem**: Multi-attester consensus for objective facts (reserve balances)
- **Enforcement Problem**: Permissionless enforcement of objective violations

### 1. ReserveOracle.sol

**Purpose**: Unified multi-attester oracle and reserve data storage

**Architecture Design**: Oracle + Slim Ledger Architecture

The ReserveOracle implements a unified architecture combining:

1. **Oracle Logic**: Handles multi-attester consensus (internal logic)
2. **Storage Layer**: Stores consensus results and maintains history (external interface)

```

**Key Features**:

- Multi-attester consensus system for reserve balance tracking
- Byzantine fault tolerance with median calculation from 3+ attesters
- Staleness detection for outdated attestations
- Historical reserve tracking and validation
- Direct integration with WatchdogEnforcer for violation detection
- Clear trust boundary between untrusted attestations and trusted consensus data

**Core Functions**:

```solidity
function submitAttestation(address qc, uint256 balance) external onlyRole(ATTESTER_ROLE)
function getReserveBalanceAndStaleness(address qc) external view returns (uint256, bool)
function getLatestReserves(address qc) external view returns (uint256)
function isReserveStale(address qc) external view returns (bool isStale, uint256 timeSinceUpdate)
function forceConsensus(address qc) external onlyRole(ARBITER_ROLE) // Emergency consensus
```

**Consensus Parameters**:

- `consensusThreshold`: 3 attestations required (configurable)
- `attestationTimeout`: 6 hours window for valid attestations
- `maxStaleness`: 24 hours before data considered stale

**Consensus Algorithm**:

- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Median calculation protects against up to 50% malicious attesters
- **Efficient Implementation**: Insertion sort + median for small attester sets (≤10 attesters)
- **Threshold Protection**: Requires minimum 3 attestations before any balance update
- **Atomic Operations**: Consensus and storage happen atomically to prevent inconsistencies
- **Deviation Tolerance**: 5% acceptable deviation to handle minor discrepancies
- **Consensus Window**: 6 hours for fresh attestations only

**Design Principles**:

1. **No Individual Attestations in Ledger**: Only consensus-validated values stored
2. **Oracle as Pure Function**: Minimal state for consensus calculation
3. **Clear Trust Boundary**: Explicit separation between proposals and facts
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Oracle solves trust, ledger solves storage

**Emergency Consensus Mechanism**:

- **Function**: `forceConsensus(address qc)` - ARBITER_ROLE only
- **Purpose**: Break consensus deadlocks when insufficient attestations prevent normal consensus
- **Safety**: Requires at least 1 valid attestation to prevent arbitrary balance setting
- **Use Case**: After QC enters UnderReview due to stale attestations, ARBITER can force consensus with available fresh attestations

**Emergency Consensus Workflow**:

1. Normal consensus fails (< 3 attestations)
2. Reserves become stale after 24 hours
3. Anyone calls `enforceObjectiveViolation()` for STALE_ATTESTATIONS
4. QC enters UnderReview status
5. Attesters continue submitting fresh attestations
6. ARBITER calls `forceConsensus()` using available attestations
7. Reserve balance updated, QC can be restored to Active

### 2. WatchdogEnforcer.sol

**Purpose**: Automated enforcement of objective violations with time-based escalation

**Key Features**:

- **Permissionless Design**: Anyone can trigger enforcement for violations
- **Limited Authority**: Can only set QCs to UnderReview status (human oversight for final decisions)
- **Objective Only**: Monitors only machine-verifiable conditions
- **Time-Based Escalation**: 45-minute delay for critical violations before emergency pause
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Works with ReserveOracle consensus data

**Core Functions**:

```solidity
function enforceObjectiveViolation(address qc, bytes32 reasonCode) external
function checkViolation(address qc, bytes32 reasonCode) external view returns (bool violated, string memory reason)
function batchCheckViolations(address[] calldata qcs, bytes32 reasonCode) external view returns (address[] memory violatedQCs)
function checkEscalation(address qc) external // 45-minute escalation trigger
function clearEscalationTimer(address qc) external // Timer cleanup
```

**Supported Violations**:

```solidity
bytes32 constant INSUFFICIENT_RESERVES = keccak256("INSUFFICIENT_RESERVES");
bytes32 constant STALE_ATTESTATIONS = keccak256("STALE_ATTESTATIONS");
bytes32 constant SUSTAINED_RESERVE_VIOLATION = keccak256(
  "SUSTAINED_RESERVE_VIOLATION"
);

```

**Expected Usage Pattern**:

- **Primary callers**: Watchdogs who continuously monitor QC compliance
- **Secondary callers**: Automated monitoring systems, community members, other participants
- **Resilience design**: Permissionless nature ensures system integrity even if watchdogs fail to act

**Escalation Flow**:

1. Violation detected → QC set to UnderReview (immediate human oversight)
2. 45-minute grace period for resolution (legal compliance)
3. If unresolved → automatic emergency pause (safety net)

### System Role Architecture

The watchdog system implements a clear role hierarchy for security and operational separation:

| Role                   | Purpose                           | Contracts                         | Authority                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **ATTESTER_ROLE**      | Submit reserve attestations       | ReserveOracle                     | Submit balance observations        |
| **ARBITER_ROLE**       | Emergency consensus & enforcement | ReserveOracle, WatchdogEnforcer   | Force consensus, QC status changes |
| **PAUSER_ROLE**        | Emergency pause controls          | SystemState                       | Emergency pause/unpause QCs        |
| **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE** | System administration             | All contracts                     | Grant/revoke roles                 |

**Role Design Principles**:

- **No overlapping definitions** - Each role has distinct, non-overlapping permissions
- **Clear separation of concerns** - Roles map to specific operational functions
- **Standardized across contracts** - Consistent role naming and usage patterns
- **Hierarchical escalation** - Clear escalation path from monitoring → enforcement → emergency action

## Protocol Integration

### Direct Bank Integration Architecture

The system achieves efficiency through direct integration with existing tBTC contracts:

**Integration Flow**:

```
QC Request → QCMinter → Bank.increaseBalanceAndCall() → TBTCVault → Auto-mint tBTC
```

**Benefits**:

- **50% Gas Reduction**: Direct calls eliminate intermediate contracts

### Integration Points

**With tBTC Core**:

- **Bank Contract**: QCMinter authorized as balance increaser
- **TBTCVault**: Receives balance increases for auto-minting
- **TBTC Token**: QCMinter has MINTER_ROLE, QCRedeemer has BURNER_ROLE

**Data Flow**:

```
User → QCMinter → Bank → TBTCVault → TBTC Tokens
         ↓
    QCManager → QCData (direct reference)
                           ↓
                    ReserveOracle ← Attesters
```
- **Proven Infrastructure**: Leverages battle-tested Bank/Vault architecture
- **Perfect Fungibility**: QC tBTC identical to Bridge tBTC
- **Operational Efficiency**: ~$375,000 annual operational savings

### Role Integration

**System Role Hierarchy**:

```
ReserveOracle:
├── Multiple ATTESTER_ROLE holders submit attestations
├── Internal consensus calculation and storage
└── Provides consensus data automatically

WatchdogEnforcer:
├── ARBITER_ROLE in QCManager (for status changes)
├── Permissionless enforcement (anyone can call)
└── Uses machine-readable reason codes
```

### Direct Integration Pattern

**Direct Integration**:

- Bank contract - Core balance management
- TBTCVault contract - Token minting/burning
- TBTC token contract - ERC-20 operations

**Registry Integration** (Flexible):

- BasicMintingPolicy (upgradeable)
- BasicRedemptionPolicy (upgradeable)
- QC management contracts
- System state and operational parameters

---

## Security Model

### Threat Model

**Protected Against**:

- Single malicious watchdog (M-of-N consensus)
- Coordination failures (independent operations)
- Emergency scenarios (automatic responses)
- Operator failures (watchdog deactivation)
- Front-running attacks (idempotent operations)

**Trust Assumptions**:

- Majority of watchdogs honest (standard assumption)
- Watchdogs are KYC'd legal entities (not anonymous)
- DAO governance acts in system interest

### Access Control Architecture

**Multi-layered Security**:

1. **Role-based Access Control**: OpenZeppelin AccessControl throughout
2. **Time-locked Governance**: 7-day delays for critical parameter changes
3. **Emergency Pause Mechanisms**: Granular pause controls per operation type
4. **Parameter Bounds**: Hard-coded limits prevent malicious configurations

### Security Features by Component

**QC Management**:

- Message signature validation for Bitcoin wallet ownership verification
- Reserve attestation staleness detection
- Capacity enforcement and validation
- Status change authorization controls

**Watchdog System**:

- M-of-N consensus for authority decisions
- Independent verification for data operations
- Emergency circuit breaker with automatic triggers
- Cooldown periods prevent spam attacks

**Protocol Integration**:

- Direct integration reduces attack surface
- Existing Bank/Vault security model maintained
- Perfect fungibility prevents protocol discrimination
- Emergency pause capabilities preserved

## Deployment Architecture

### Contract Deployment Order

The system deploys through numbered scripts ensuring proper dependency resolution:

**Core Infrastructure (Scripts 95-99)**:

1. `95_deploy_account_control_core.ts` - Core entry points (QCMinter, QCRedeemer with direct dependencies)
2. `96_deploy_account_control_state.ts` - State management (QCData, SystemState, QCManager)
3. `97_deploy_account_control_policies.ts` - Policy contracts (BasicMintingPolicy, BasicRedemptionPolicy)
4. `98_deploy_reserve_oracle.ts` - Reserve tracking and watchdog system (ReserveOracle, WatchdogEnforcer)
5. `99_configure_account_control_system.ts` - Role assignments and final configuration

**Supporting Infrastructure**: 6. `30_deploy_message_signing.ts` - Bitcoin message signature validation (MessageSigning)

### Production Deployment Strategy

**Multi-Environment Approach**:

1. **Development**: Single attester for ReserveOracle, fast parameters for testing
2. **Staging**: Multiple attesters, realistic timing parameters for validation
3. **Production**: Minimum 3 attesters for Byzantine fault tolerance, secure parameters

**Reserve Attestation Scaling**:

```
Environment    Min Attesters    Consensus Method    Timing
Development    1               Direct submission    Fast (minutes)
Staging        2-3             Median calculation   Medium (hours)
Production     3+              Byzantine tolerant   Secure (hours)
```

### Geographic Distribution

**Operational Security Requirements**:

- Independent deployment by different operators
- Geographic distribution across regions
- Organizational independence (different legal entities)

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Overview

This section records significant architectural decisions made during the development of the Account Control system for tBTC v2.

### ADR-001: Watchdog System Simplification

**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Status**: Accepted and Implemented

**Context**: Alternative approaches considered included complex systems with 6+ contracts with overlapping responsibilities:

- WatchdogAutomatedEnforcement
- WatchdogConsensusManager
- WatchdogDAOEscalation
- WatchdogThresholdActions
- WatchdogMonitor
- QCWatchdog

Critical issue identified: **Machines cannot interpret human-readable strings** - the OptimisticWatchdogConsensus expected automated systems to understand strings like "excessive_slippage_observed".

**Decision**: Migrate to a simplified 3-contract architecture focused on objective enforcement:

1. **Oracle Problem** → `ReserveOracle` (multi-attester consensus)
2. **Enforcement** → `WatchdogEnforcer` (permissionless with reason codes)
3. **Validation** → `WatchdogReasonCodes` (machine-readable violation codes)

**Consequences**:

- Positive: 50% reduction in contracts (6 → 3), machine-readable reason codes enable automation, no single points of trust, gas optimization through minimal state
- Negative: Additional complexity to implement, documentation updates needed, retraining for operators

### ADR-002: Machine-Readable Reason Codes

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Status**: Accepted and Implemented

**Context**: Original system used human-readable strings for violations like "excessive_slippage_observed", "suspicious_minting_pattern". Machines cannot interpret semantic meaning from strings.

**Decision**: Replace strings with standardized bytes32 reason codes:

```solidity
bytes32 constant INSUFFICIENT_RESERVES = keccak256("INSUFFICIENT_RESERVES");
bytes32 constant STALE_ATTESTATIONS = keccak256("STALE_ATTESTATIONS");

```

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Enables automated validation, reduces gas costs (bytes32 vs string), prevents interpretation attacks
- Negative: Less human-readable in logs, requires mapping for UI display

### ADR-003: Oracle Consensus for Reserve Attestations

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Status**: Accepted and Implemented

**Context**: Original design trusted a single attester for reserve balances - single point of failure. User feedback: "we don't trust single watchdogs"

**Decision**: Implement multi-attester oracle consensus:

- Minimum 3 attesters required
- Median calculation for robustness
- Automatic consensus when threshold met

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Eliminates single trust point, Byzantine fault tolerance, robust against manipulation
- Negative: Higher operational complexity, requires multiple attesters, slightly higher gas costs

### ADR-004: Remove proposedAction Field

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Status**: Accepted and Implemented

**Context**: Initial design included `proposedAction` field in subjective reports. User feedback: "watchdogs should report observations, DAO should investigate and make judgment"

**Decision**: Remove `proposedAction` field entirely. Watchdogs only report observations, DAO decides actions.

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Clear separation of concerns, prevents watchdog overreach, simplifies report structure
- Negative: DAO must interpret observations, no automated remediation hints

### ADR-005: No Rate Limiting for Reports

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Status**: Accepted and Implemented

**Context**: Proposed various rate limiting mechanisms to prevent spam. User feedback: "I don't think any rate-limiting ideas you shared are actually good"

**Decision**: No explicit rate limiting - rely on:

- Gas costs as natural deterrent
- Role-gating (WATCHDOG_ROLE required)
- Support thresholds for importance

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Simpler implementation, no artificial constraints, emergencies not blocked
- Negative: Potential for spam if gas is cheap, requires active DAO monitoring

### ADR-006: Evidence Storage via Hashes

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Status**: Accepted and Implemented

**Context**: Need to store evidence for subjective reports without DoS vulnerability.

**Decision**: Store evidence hashes on-chain (max 20 per report), actual content via watchdog REST APIs.

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Bounded on-chain storage, no DoS vulnerability, leverages existing infrastructure
- Negative: Requires off-chain availability, trust in watchdog REST APIs

### ADR-007: Direct DAO Action Model

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Status**: Accepted and Implemented

**Context**: Initial design included WatchdogDAOBridge as intermediary. User feedback: "why cant the dao simply observe onchain reporting, discuss it offchain and then take action?"

**Decision**: Remove DAOBridge entirely. DAO monitors events directly and takes action through governance.

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Eliminates unnecessary contract, simpler architecture, direct accountability
- Negative: Requires DAO tooling for monitoring, no automated escalation

### ADR-009: Permissionless Enforcement

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Status**: Accepted and Implemented

**Context**: Original system required specific roles to trigger enforcement actions.

**Decision**: Allow anyone to call `enforceObjectiveViolation()` - validation ensures only real violations trigger.

**Consequences**:

- Positive: No dependency on specific operators, faster response to violations, increased system resilience
- Negative: Potential for griefing attempts, higher validation gas costs

### ADR-010: Support-Based Report Filtering

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Status**: Accepted and Implemented

**Context**: Need mechanism to filter important reports without explicit severity levels.

**Decision**: Use support count as natural importance indicator:

- SECURITY_OBSERVATION: 0 supporters (immediate)
- COMPLIANCE_QUESTION: 1 supporter
- Others: 3 supporters for visibility

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Organic importance emergence, no artificial severity scale, community-driven prioritization
- Negative: Requires multiple watchdogs, delayed response for non-critical

### Architecture Decisions Summary

The architectural decisions reflect a philosophy of:

1. **Simplification** over feature completeness
2. **Trust distribution** over efficiency
3. **Clear separation** over integration
4. **Machine readability** over human interpretation
5. **Direct action** over intermediation

These decisions resulted in a 33% reduction in contract count while improving security and clarity.

## Architectural Evolution & Design Decisions

### Simplification Timeline (July-August 2025)

The Account Control system underwent significant architectural simplification following mature engineering principles:

**2025-08-04**: Documentation consolidation begins
**2025-08-05**: Remove unnecessary authorization checks  
**2025-08-06**: Simplify watchdog from 6 contracts to 2-contract system
**2025-08-07**: Remove WatchdogReasonCodes library (inline codes)
**2025-08-08**: Remove policy interfaces following YAGNI principle

### Policy Removal Rationale

The removal of BasicMintingPolicy and BasicRedemptionPolicy represents intentional architectural simplification:

**Why Removed:**
1. **Gas Optimization**: Eliminated ~5,000 gas overhead per operation
2. **Simplified Architecture**: Direct call patterns preferred over abstraction layers
3. **Reduced Attack Surface**: Fewer contracts in critical paths
4. **Easier Testing**: No interface mocking requirements
5. **Clearer Code Paths**: No delegation layer complexity

**What Replaced Them:**
- QCMinter: Embedded minting logic with direct Bank integration
- QCRedeemer: Embedded redemption logic with internal validation

This demonstrates mature engineering: willingness to remove complexity that doesn't add value.

### Security Implementation Status

| Security Feature | Implementation | Quality Assessment |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **ReentrancyGuard** | Applied to all external functions | Excellent |
| **Access Control** | OpenZeppelin AccessControl throughout | Excellent |
| **Input Validation** | Custom errors for gas efficiency | Excellent |
| **Emergency Pauses** | Granular pause mechanisms | Excellent |
| **Parameter Bounds** | Hard-coded limits prevent attacks | Excellent |
| **Event Logging** | Comprehensive audit trail | Excellent |

### Code Quality Metrics

| Aspect | Assessment | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|

| **Error Handling** | Excellent | Custom errors for gas efficiency |
| **Gas Optimization** | Excellent | Direct references, immutable contracts |
| **Testing Integration** | Good | Event emissions for monitoring |
| **Upgrade Patterns** | Good | Direct integration pattern |

## Operational Model

### 5-State Model Features

**Network Continuity Focus**:
- **60% State Availability**: 3 out of 5 states allow redemption fulfillment
- **Graduated Response**: Issues handled proportionally to severity  
- **Self-Recovery**: QCs can resume from self-initiated pauses

**State Definitions**:
- **Active**: Full operations - can mint and fulfill redemptions
- **MintingPaused**: Can fulfill redemptions but cannot mint new tBTC (self-initiated or watchdog)
- **Paused**: Self-initiated maintenance pause, cannot mint or fulfill (48h max)
- **UnderReview**: Council review state, can fulfill but cannot mint
- **Revoked**: Permanently disabled, no operations allowed

**State Transition Rules**:
```
Active ↔ MintingPaused (QC self-pause for routine maintenance)
MintingPaused → Paused (QC escalates for full maintenance)
Paused → UnderReview (Auto-escalation after 48h if not resumed)
MintingPaused/Paused → Active (QC resumes early)
UnderReview → Active/Revoked (Council decision)
```

### Renewable Pause Credit Mechanism

QCs receive renewable pause credits for operational flexibility:

- **Initial Grant**: 1 credit upon QC registration
- **Renewal Period**: 1 new credit every 90 days
- **Maximum Credits**: 1 (no accumulation)
- **Usage**: Consumed when self-pausing (MintingPaused or Paused)
- **Recovery**: Must wait 90 days for renewal after use

### Auto-Escalation Timer

Self-initiated pauses have automatic escalation to prevent indefinite disruption:

```
Self-Pause Initiated (MintingPaused/Paused)
        ↓
48-Hour Timer Starts
        ↓
QC Can Resume Anytime (resumeSelfPause)
        ↓
If Not Resumed After 48h:
        ↓
Watchdog Calls checkEscalation()
        ↓
Auto-Escalate to UnderReview
        ↓
Emergency Council Intervention Required
```

### Default Tracking & Progressive Consequences

The system tracks redemption defaults with graduated consequences:

**Timing Parameters**:
- **Consecutive Default Window**: 30 days (resets if no defaults)
- **Recovery Period**: 90 days between penalty tiers
- **First Default**: Active → MintingPaused (can still fulfill)
- **Second Default**: MintingPaused → UnderReview (council review)
- **Third Default**: UnderReview → Revoked (permanent termination)

**Default Recovery Path**:
- Clear redemption backlog
- Maintain good standing for recovery period
- Council approval for UnderReview → Active transition

### Emergency Response Quick Reference

**Key Emergency Functions**:
- `emergencyPauseQC(address qc, bytes32 reason)` - QC-specific pause (7-day auto-expire)
- `forceConsensus()` - Override attestation deadlocks (requires ≥1 valid attestation)
- `pauseMinting()` / `pauseRedemption()` - Global function pauses
- `checkEscalation(address qc)` - Trigger escalation after 45-minute timer
- `enforceObjectiveViolation(qc, reasonCode)` - Permissionless violation enforcement

**Emergency Authority**:
- **PAUSER_ROLE**: Execute pauses (Emergency Council)
- **ARBITER_ROLE**: Force consensus, resolve disputes
- **Anyone**: Trigger objective violations via WatchdogEnforcer

---

## Security Architecture

The tBTC v2 Account Control system implements a comprehensive security architecture based on:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 17 distinct roles with specific permissions
2. **State Change Authority**: Centralized state management with clear authority boundaries
3. **Objective Enforcement**: Automated detection and enforcement of protocol violations
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security checks and validations

### Security Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each role has minimum required permissions
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between authority levels
3. **Trust Distribution**: No single point of trust or failure
4. **Machine Readability**: Objective violations use machine-readable codes
5. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: System defaults to secure states

### Role-Based Access Control

#### Role Categories

The system implements 17 distinct roles across 4 categories:

**1. Administrative Roles**

- **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE (0x00)**: Ultimate admin authority in all contracts
- **PARAMETER_ADMIN_ROLE**: System parameter management
- **MANAGER_ROLE**: Operational management and configuration

**2. Operational Roles**

- **PAUSER_ROLE**: Emergency pause capabilities
- **MINTER_ROLE**: Authorization to mint tBTC
- **REDEEMER_ROLE**: Process redemption requests
- **ARBITER_ROLE**: Handle disputes and full status changes

**3. Watchdog Roles**

- **WATCHDOG_ROLE**: Participate in consensus voting
- **WATCHDOG_OPERATOR_ROLE**: Individual watchdog operations
- **WATCHDOG_ENFORCER_ROLE**: Limited enforcement (UnderReview only)
- **ATTESTER_ROLE**: Submit reserve attestations
- **REGISTRAR_ROLE**: Register Bitcoin wallets

**4. QC Management Roles**

- **QC_ADMIN_ROLE**: QC administrative operations
- **QC_MANAGER_ROLE**: Modify QC data
- **QC_GOVERNANCE_ROLE**: QC governance decisions
- **ESCALATOR_ROLE**: Create DAO escalation proposals

#### Critical Role Definitions

**ARBITER_ROLE**

**Purpose**: Authority for disputes and full status changes  
**Capabilities**:

- Change QC status (any valid transition)
- Flag defaulted redemptions
- Handle dispute resolution
- Force consensus when needed

**Holders**:

- Governance multisig
- Emergency responders

**WATCHDOG_ENFORCER_ROLE**

**Purpose**: Limited enforcement authority for objective violations  
**Capabilities**:

- ONLY set QCs to UnderReview status
- Cannot set Active or Revoked status
- Used for automated enforcement

**Holders**:

- WatchdogEnforcer contract (not individuals)

#### Contract-Role Mapping

```
QCManager:
├── DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE → Full control
├── ARBITER_ROLE → Any status change
├── WATCHDOG_ENFORCER_ROLE → Only UnderReview
├── REGISTRAR_ROLE → Wallet registration
└── QC_ADMIN_ROLE → QC administration

QCReserveLedger:
├── DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE → Full control
├── ATTESTER_ROLE → Submit attestations
└── ARBITER_ROLE → Force consensus

SystemState:
├── DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE → Full control
├── PARAMETER_ADMIN_ROLE → Parameter updates
└── PAUSER_ROLE → Pause operations
```

### State Change Authority Model

#### Core Design Principle

**QCManager is the ONLY contract that can change QC status.**

This centralized approach ensures:

- Proper validation of state transitions
- Consistent event emission
- Authority checking
- Business logic enforcement

#### Authority Boundaries

```solidity
// FULL Authority - Can make any valid transition
ARBITER_ROLE → setQCStatus(qc, newStatus, reason)

// LIMITED Authority - Can only set to UnderReview
WATCHDOG_ENFORCER_ROLE → requestStatusChange(qc, UnderReview, reason)

// INTERNAL Authority - Solvency checks
_executeStatusChange(qc, UnderReview, reason, "SOLVENCY_CHECK")
```

#### State Machine Rules

```
┌─────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│ Active  │◄──►│ UnderReview  │───►│ Revoked │
└─────────┘    └──────────────┘    └─────────┘
     │                                   ▲
     └───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Valid Transitions**

- **Active → UnderReview**: Temporary suspension (any authority)
- **MintingPaused → UnderReview**: Escalation (any authority)  
- **Paused → UnderReview**: Escalation (any authority)
- **UnderReview → Active**: Issues resolved (ARBITER only)
- **ANY State → Revoked**: Permanent termination (ARBITER only) - Revoked is reachable from all states
- **Revoked → \***: No transitions (terminal state)

#### Implementation Pattern

```solidity
contract QCManager {
    /// @notice ONLY way to change QC status
    function _executeStatusChange(
        address qc,
        QCData.QCStatus newStatus,
        bytes32 reason,
        string memory authority
    ) private {
        // Centralized validation
        if (!qcData.isQCRegistered(qc)) revert QCNotRegistered(qc);
        if (!_isValidStatusTransition(oldStatus, newStatus))
            revert InvalidStatusTransition(...);

        // State change
        qcData.setQCStatus(qc, newStatus, reason);

        // Event emission
        emit QCStatusChanged(...);
    }
}
```

### Objective Violations & Enforcement

#### WatchdogEnforcer Design

The system implements automated enforcement for objective (machine-verifiable) violations through the WatchdogEnforcer contract.

**Current Violations**

1. **INSUFFICIENT_RESERVES**: QC reserves below 100% collateral ratio

   - Data Source: QCReserveLedger consensus + QCData minted amount
   - Validation: `reserves < (mintedAmount * minCollateralRatio()) / 100`

2. **STALE_ATTESTATIONS**: Reserve data older than 24 hours
   - Data Source: QCReserveLedger staleness tracking
   - Validation: `block.timestamp > lastUpdate + maxStaleness`

**Enforcement Architecture**

```solidity
function enforceObjectiveViolation(address qc, bytes32 reasonCode) external {
  // Validate objective violation
  if (reasonCode != INSUFFICIENT_RESERVES && reasonCode != STALE_ATTESTATIONS) {
    revert NotObjectiveViolation();
  }

  // Check violation
  (bool violated, string memory reason) = checkViolation(qc, reasonCode);

  // Execute enforcement
  if (violated) {
    qcManager.requestStatusChange(qc, UnderReview, reasonCode);
  }
}
```

#### Future Violation Expansion

The architecture supports 3-8 total objective violations:

**High Priority Additions**

- **ZERO_RESERVES_WITH_MINTED_TOKENS**: Critical safety check
- **EMERGENCY_PAUSE_EXPIRED**: Automated cleanup of expired pauses

**Medium Priority Additions**

- **REDEMPTION_TIMEOUT_EXCEEDED**: Unfulfilled redemptions
- **ATTESTATION_CONSENSUS_FAILURE**: Systemic attestation problems

#### Emergency Consensus Mechanism

The QCReserveLedger includes emergency consensus for deadlock situations:

```solidity
function forceConsensus(address qc) external onlyRole(ARBITER_ROLE) {
  // Requires at least 1 valid attestation
  // Uses median calculation
  // Maintains Byzantine fault tolerance
}
```

**Workflow**:

1. Normal consensus fails (< 3 attestations)
2. Reserves become stale after 24 hours
3. Anyone triggers STALE_ATTESTATIONS violation
4. QC enters UnderReview status
5. ARBITER forces consensus with available attestations
6. QC can be restored to Active

### Cross-Contract Security

#### Critical Permission Dependencies

1. **WatchdogEnforcer → QCManager**

   - Requires: WATCHDOG_ENFORCER_ROLE
   - Purpose: Set QCs to UnderReview

2. **BasicMintingPolicy → Bank**

   - Requires: Authorization in `authorizedBalanceIncreasers`
   - Purpose: Mint tBTC tokens

3. **QCManager → QCData**

   - Requires: QC_MANAGER_ROLE
   - Purpose: Modify QC storage

4. **QCWatchdog → QCReserveLedger**
   - Requires: ATTESTER_ROLE
   - Purpose: Submit reserve attestations

#### Security Boundaries

```
Untrusted Zone          Trust Boundary          Trusted Zone
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━         ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━         ━━━━━━━━━━━━
External Calls  →      Validation      →      State Changes
User Input             Access Control           Storage Updates
Attestations           Business Logic           Token Operations
```

### Security Best Practices

#### Development Guidelines

1. **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**

   ```solidity
   // 1. Checks
   require(valid, "Invalid");

   // 2. Effects
   state = newState;

   // 3. Interactions
   external.call();
   ```

2. **Access Control Modifiers**

   ```solidity
   modifier onlyRole(bytes32 role) {
       require(hasRole(role, msg.sender), "Missing role");
       _;
   }
   ```

3. **Reentrancy Protection**
   - Use `nonReentrant` modifier for external functions
   - State changes before external calls

#### Operational Security

1. **Role Management**

   - Two-step role transfers
   - Regular role audits
   - Time-locked admin changes

2. **Emergency Response**

   - Multiple PAUSER_ROLE holders
   - Clear pause procedures
   - Maximum pause durations (7 days)

3. **Monitoring Requirements**
   - Event log analysis
   - Role assignment tracking
   - Violation detection alerts

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**❌ Direct State Modification**

```solidity
// DON'T: Bypass validation
qcData.setQCStatus(qc, newStatus, reason);
```

**❌ Multiple Authority Paths**

```solidity
// DON'T: Inconsistent validation
if (hasRole(ROLE_A)) {
    // Different logic
} else if (hasRole(ROLE_B)) {
    // Different logic
}
```

**❌ Missing Validation**

```solidity
// DON'T: No transition validation
function setStatus(...) external {
    storage.status = newStatus;  // No checks!
}
```

### Incident Response

#### Response Levels

1. **Level 1: Automated Response**

   - Objective violations trigger UnderReview
   - No human intervention required
   - Example: Insufficient reserves

2. **Level 2: Arbiter Intervention**

   - Human review of UnderReview QCs
   - Decision to restore or revoke
   - Example: Resolved collateral issues

3. **Level 3: Emergency Pause**

   - System-wide or QC-specific pause
   - Maximum 7-day duration
   - Example: Critical vulnerability

4. **Level 4: Governance Action**
   - DAO proposal and vote
   - Parameter changes or upgrades
   - Example: Protocol modifications

#### Response Procedures

```
Detection → Assessment → Response → Recovery
    ↓           ↓           ↓          ↓
 Events    Severity    Action    Validation
 Alerts    Impact      Execute   Verify
```

#### Post-Incident Actions

1. **Documentation**

   - Incident timeline
   - Actions taken
   - Lessons learned

2. **System Updates**

   - Parameter adjustments
   - Role modifications
   - Process improvements

3. **Communication**
   - Stakeholder notification
   - Public disclosure
   - Remediation plan
