# Documentation Status Report

**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Purpose**: Track documentation updates after watchdog system migration

## Summary

Documentation has been updated to reflect the simplified watchdog system (v2.0) that replaced the complex dual-path architecture.

## Completed Updates

### PRD Directory (✅ Complete)
- **README.md** - Updated with migration details and Three-Problem Framework
- **REQUIREMENTS.md** - Updated all watchdog references to simplified system
- **FLOWS.md** - Updated flows for oracle consensus and permissionless enforcement
- **RESEARCH.md** - Added historical note about system evolution

### Core Documentation (✅ Complete)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Replaced V1.1/V1.2 sections with simplified watchdog system
- **ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md** - Created with 10 ADRs documenting key decisions
- **DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md** - This file

### Archival Work (✅ Complete)
- Moved 9 analysis docs to `archive/watchdog-migration/`
- Moved V1.1/V1.2 specific docs to `archive/v1.1-v1.2/`
  - ARCHITECTURE_V1.1_V1.2.md
  - CONTRACT_INTERFACES_V1.1_V1.2.md
  - DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_V1.1_V1.2.md
  - SECURITY_REVIEW_V1.1_V1.2.md
  - SEQUENCE_DIAGRAMS_V1.1_V1.2.md

## Files Requiring Updates

### High Priority
1. **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Contains old QCWatchdog and ConsensusManager references
2. **WATCHDOG_GUIDE.md** - 50+ outdated references need updating

### Medium Priority
3. **ROLE_MATRIX.md** - Needs role updates for new system
4. **GAS_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md** - May reference old contracts

### Low Priority (Historical/Analysis)
5. Phase 1-4 summaries - Historical analysis, may not need updates

## Key Changes to Document

### System Architecture
- **Old**: 6 watchdog contracts (QCWatchdog, ConsensusManager, Monitor, etc.)
- **Current**: 4 contracts (ReserveOracle, WatchdogEnforcer, SubjectiveReporting, ReasonCodes)

### Trust Model
- **Old**: Single trusted watchdog entity
- **Current**: Multi-attester oracle consensus, no single point of trust

### Enforcement
- **Old**: Role-gated consensus required
- **Current**: Permissionless enforcement with machine-readable codes

### Reporting
- **Old**: Complex state machines and escalation
- **Current**: Simple event emission for DAO monitoring

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Update IMPLEMENTATION.md and WATCHDOG_GUIDE.md
2. **Soon**: Create new simplified deployment guide
3. **Consider**: Consolidating multiple analysis reports into single document
4. **Archive**: Move Phase 1-4 reports to archive if purely historical

## Migration Rationale

The migration addressed fundamental issues:
1. **Machine Interpretation**: Contracts expected machines to understand human strings
2. **Single Point of Trust**: One attester for critical operations
3. **Over-Complexity**: 6+ contracts with overlapping responsibilities
4. **State Machine Overhead**: Complex voting for objective facts

The new system implements the Three-Problem Framework:
- **Oracle Problem**: Multi-attester consensus
- **Observation Problem**: Transparent reporting
- **Decision Problem**: Direct DAO action
