## 1. Current Monitoring State

### 1.1 Existing Capabilities

**Current Event Architecture**:

```solidity
// From ARCHITECTURE.md - existing events
event QCStatusChanged(address indexed qc, QCStatus oldStatus, QCStatus newStatus, bytes32 reason)
event WalletRegistered(address indexed qc, string btcAddress)
event ReserveAttestationSubmitted(address indexed attester, address indexed qc, uint256 newBalance, uint256 timestamp)
event QCMintRequested(address indexed qc, uint256 amount)
event RedemptionRequested(bytes32 indexed redemptionId, address indexed user, address indexed qc, uint256 amount)
```

**Current Monitoring Gaps**:

- No capacity utilization tracking
- Limited performance metrics per QC
- No proactive alerting for degraded conditions
- Missing gas optimization monitoring
- Insufficient early warning systems

### 1.2 Requirements from Architecture Review

**Identified Monitoring Needs**:

1. **Capacity Management**: Real-time QC capacity utilization
2. **Performance Tracking**: Success rates and response times
3. **Freshness Monitoring**: Attestation staleness detection
4. **Gas Optimization**: Cost efficiency tracking
5. **Predictive Alerting**: Early warning systems

## 3. Implementation Considerations

### 3.1 Technical Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Smart Contract Changes

**Required Contract Enhancements**:

```solidity
// Enhanced event structure for monitoring
event QCCapacityUpdate(
    address indexed qc,
    uint256 currentMinted,
    uint256 maxCapacity,
    uint256 utilizationPercentage,
    uint256 timestamp
);

event OperationPerformanceMetric(
    address indexed qc,
    bytes32 indexed operationType,
    bool success,
    uint256 gasUsed,
    uint256 responseTime,
    uint256 timestamp
);

// New monitoring interface
interface IAccountControlMonitoring {
    function getQCCapacityMetrics(address qc) external view returns (CapacityMetrics memory);
    function getSystemHealthIndicators() external view returns (SystemHealth memory);
    function getPerformanceHistory(address qc, uint256 timeWindow) external view returns (PerformanceData memory);
}
```

**Gas Cost Impact**:

- Estimated additional gas per operation: 5,000-10,000 gas
- Trade-off: Enhanced monitoring vs. gas efficiency
- Mitigation: Optional monitoring mode for cost-sensitive operations

#### 3.1.2 Off-Chain Infrastructure

**Monitoring Stack Requirements**:

```yaml
# Infrastructure Components
event_indexer:
  purpose: "Real-time event processing and aggregation"
  technology: "TheGraph or custom indexer"
  requirements: [high_availability, low_latency]

metrics_database:
  purpose: "Time-series data storage"
  technology: "InfluxDB or Prometheus"
  requirements: [high_throughput, data_retention]

alerting_system:
  purpose: "Intelligent alert processing and escalation"
  technology: "PagerDuty or custom system"
  requirements: [reliability, escalation_chains]

dashboard_system:
