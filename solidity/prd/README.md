## Executive Summary

### What is Account Control?

Account Control enables **Qualified Custodians** (regulated institutional entities) to mint tBTC tokens against their segregated Bitcoin reserves through **direct Bank integration**. This expands tBTC liquidity while maintaining the security and decentralization principles of the original protocol.

### Key Innovation: Direct Bank Integration

Unlike abstraction-layer approaches, Account Control integrates directly with the existing tBTC Bank/Vault architecture:

```
User ‚Üí QCMinter ‚Üí BasicMintingPolicy ‚Üí Bank ‚Üí TBTCVault ‚Üí tBTC Tokens
```

### Core Features

- **üè¶ Direct Bank Integration**: Seamless integration with proven Bank/Vault infrastructure
- **üîß Modular Architecture**: Policy-driven contracts enable future upgrades without disruption
- **üëÅÔ∏è Dual-Path Watchdog**: Individual QCWatchdog instances + M-of-N consensus for critical operations
- **üõ°Ô∏è Segregated Reserves**: Individual QC reserves prevent systemic gridlock
- **‚ö° Simple State Machine**: Clean 3-state QC model (Active, UnderReview, Revoked)

### Business Benefits

- **üìà Liquidity Expansion**: Institutional custodian participation increases tBTC supply
- **üèõÔ∏è Institutional Integration**: Compliant pathway for regulated entities in DeFi
- **üí∞ Capital Efficiency**: Maximizes QC minting capacity relative to reserves
- **üîí Risk Management**: Segregated reserves contain QC failures

| **QCMinter**                    | Stable entry point           | Policy delegation, emergency pause                |
| **QCRedeemer**                  | Redemption engine            | Lifecycle management, default handling            |

#### Simplified Watchdog System (v2.0)
| Component                       | Purpose                      | Key Features                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **WatchdogReasonCodes**         | Machine-readable violations  | Standardized codes for automated validation       |
| **ReserveOracle**               | Multi-attester consensus     | Median calculation, eliminates single trust point |
| **WatchdogReporting** | Transparent reporting        | Simple event emission for DAO monitoring          |
| **WatchdogEnforcer**            | Permissionless enforcement   | Anyone can trigger objective violations           |

### Integration with Existing tBTC v2

The system deploys as an **independent contract suite** without modifying existing contracts:

- **Bank Authorization**: BasicMintingPolicy authorized via `authorizedBalanceIncreasers`
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Uses same Bank/Vault/Token contracts as regular Bridge
- **Perfect Fungibility**: QC-minted tBTC indistinguishable from Bridge-minted tBTC
- **Coexistence**: Regular Bridge operations continue unchanged

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Direct Bank Integration?

- **Simplicity**: Eliminates unnecessary abstraction layers
- **Proven Infrastructure**: Leverages battle-tested Bank/Vault architecture
- **Gas Efficiency**: Direct integration reduces transaction costs
- **Reduced Risk**: Fewer contracts in the critical path

### Watchdog System Migration (v2.0)

#### The Problem with v1.x
The original watchdog system had fundamental issues:
- **Machine Interpretation Problem**: Contracts expected machines to interpret human-readable strings
- **Single Point of Trust**: One attester for critical reserve attestations
- **Over-Complexity**: 6+ overlapping contracts with unclear responsibilities
- **State Machine Overhead**: Complex voting and escalation for objective facts

#### The Solution: Three-Problem Framework
We identified three distinct problems requiring different solutions:

1. **Oracle Problem** (Objective Facts)
   - Solution: Multi-attester consensus via `ReserveOracle`
   - Multiple attesters submit reserve balances, median calculation prevents manipulation

2. **Observation Problem** (Subjective Concerns)  
   - Solution: Simple transparent reporting via `WatchdogReporting`
   - Watchdogs report observations, DAO monitors events and investigates

3. **Decision Problem** (Governance Actions)
   - Solution: Direct DAO action without intermediary contracts
   - DAO observes reports, discusses off-chain, takes action directly

#### Migration Benefits
- **33% Fewer Contracts**: 6 old contracts ‚Üí 4 new contracts
- **Machine-Readable**: Reason codes enable automated validation
- **Trust Distribution**: No single points of failure
- **Permissionless Enforcement**: Anyone can trigger objective violations
- **Gas Optimization**: Minimal state, fewer cross-contract calls

### Why Policy-Driven Architecture?

- **Upgradeability**: Business logic can evolve without core contract changes
- **Future-Proofing**: Clear path from attestation-based V1 to crypto-economic V2
- **Interface Stability**: Core contracts maintain stable interfaces
- **Risk Management**: Isolated upgrade risks to policy contracts only
