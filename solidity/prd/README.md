## Executive Summary

### What is Account Control?

Account Control enables **Qualified Custodians** (regulated institutional entities) to mint tBTC tokens against their segregated Bitcoin reserves through **direct Bank integration**. This expands tBTC liquidity while maintaining the security and decentralization principles of the original protocol.

### Key Innovation: Direct Bank Integration

Unlike abstraction-layer approaches, Account Control integrates directly with the existing tBTC Bank/Vault architecture:

```
User ‚Üí QCMinter ‚Üí BasicMintingPolicy ‚Üí Bank ‚Üí TBTCVault ‚Üí tBTC Tokens
```

### Core Features

- **üè¶ Direct Bank Integration**: Seamless integration with proven Bank/Vault infrastructure
- **üîß Modular Architecture**: Policy-driven contracts enable future upgrades without disruption
- **üëÅÔ∏è Dual-Path Watchdog**: Individual QCWatchdog instances + M-of-N consensus for critical operations
- **üõ°Ô∏è Segregated Reserves**: Individual QC reserves prevent systemic gridlock
- **‚ö° Simple State Machine**: Clean 3-state QC model (Active, UnderReview, Revoked)

### Business Benefits

- **üìà Liquidity Expansion**: Institutional custodian participation increases tBTC supply
- **üèõÔ∏è Institutional Integration**: Compliant pathway for regulated entities in DeFi
- **üí∞ Capital Efficiency**: Maximizes QC minting capacity relative to reserves
- **üîí Risk Management**: Segregated reserves contain QC failures

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

| Component                       | Purpose                      | Key Features                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **BasicMintingPolicy**          | Direct Bank integration      | Auto-minting, capacity validation, error handling |
| **ProtocolRegistry**            | Central service registry     | Component upgrades, dependency management         |
| **QCManager**                   | Business logic               | Stateless QC management, capacity calculations    |
| **QCData**                      | Storage layer                | Pure storage, gas-optimized, audit-friendly       |
| **QCMinter**                    | Stable entry point           | Policy delegation, emergency pause                |
| **QCRedeemer**                  | Redemption engine            | Lifecycle management, default handling            |
| **QCWatchdog**                  | Individual watchdog proxy    | Routine operations, SPV verification              |
| **WatchdogConsensusManager**    | M-of-N consensus             | Critical operations voting, Byzantine fault tolerance |
| **WatchdogAutomatedEnforcement** | V1.2 automated rules        | Deterministic enforcement, 90%+ automation       |

### Integration with Existing tBTC v2

The system deploys as an **independent contract suite** without modifying existing contracts:

- **Bank Authorization**: BasicMintingPolicy authorized via `authorizedBalanceIncreasers`
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Uses same Bank/Vault/Token contracts as regular Bridge
- **Perfect Fungibility**: QC-minted tBTC indistinguishable from Bridge-minted tBTC
- **Coexistence**: Regular Bridge operations continue unchanged

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Direct Bank Integration?

- **Simplicity**: Eliminates unnecessary abstraction layers
- **Proven Infrastructure**: Leverages battle-tested Bank/Vault architecture
- **Gas Efficiency**: Direct integration reduces transaction costs
- **Reduced Risk**: Fewer contracts in the critical path

### Why Single Watchdog?

- **Operational Simplicity**: Clear responsibility and accountability
- **Faster Response**: No consensus delays for critical operations
- **DAO Oversight**: Watchdog appointed and monitored by DAO
- **Future Evolution**: Clear path to M-of-N decentralization in V2

### Why Policy-Driven Architecture?

- **Upgradeability**: Business logic can evolve without core contract changes
- **Future-Proofing**: Clear path from attestation-based V1 to crypto-economic V2
- **Interface Stability**: Core contracts maintain stable interfaces
- **Risk Management**: Isolated upgrade risks to policy contracts only
