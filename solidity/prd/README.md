## Executive Summary

### What is Account Control?

Account Control enables **Qualified Custodians** (regulated institutional entities) to mint tBTC tokens against their segregated Bitcoin reserves through **direct Bank integration**. This expands tBTC liquidity while maintaining the security and decentralization principles of the original protocol.

### Key Innovation: Direct Bank Integration

Account Control integrates directly with the existing tBTC Bank/Vault architecture:

```
User ‚Üí QCMinter (with embedded policy) ‚Üí Bank ‚Üí TBTCVault ‚Üí tBTC Tokens
```

### Core Features

- **üè¶ Direct Bank Integration**: Seamless integration with proven Bank/Vault infrastructure
- **üîß Modular Architecture**: Policy-driven contracts enable future upgrades without disruption
- **üëÅÔ∏è Simplified Watchdog**: Multi-attester consensus + permissionless enforcement
- **üõ°Ô∏è Segregated Reserves**: Individual QC reserves prevent systemic gridlock
- **‚ö° 5-State QC Model**: Advanced state management with self-pause and auto-escalation (Active, MintingPaused, Paused, UnderReview, Revoked)

### Business Benefits

- **üìà Liquidity Expansion**: Institutional custodian participation increases tBTC supply
- **üèõÔ∏è Institutional Integration**: Compliant pathway for regulated entities in DeFi
- **üí∞ Capital Efficiency**: Maximizes QC minting capacity relative to reserves
- **üîí Risk Management**: Segregated reserves contain QC failures

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

#### Core Account Control
| Component                       | Purpose                      | Key Features                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **QCMinter**                    | Minting operations           | Direct Bank integration, embedded policy logic    |
| **QCRedeemer**                  | Redemption operations        | Embedded redemption logic, default handling       |
| **QCManager**                   | Business logic               | QC management, capacity calculations, SPV verification |
| **QCData**                      | Storage layer                | 5-state enum, gas-optimized, audit-friendly      |
| **QCStateManager**              | State transition logic       | 5-state management, auto-escalation, graduated consequences |
| **QCRenewablePause**            | Pause credit system          | 90-day renewable credits, self-pause capabilities |
| **SystemState**                 | Global configuration         | System parameters, emergency pause                |

#### Simplified Watchdog System (v2.0)
| Component                       | Purpose                      | Key Features                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **WatchdogReasonCodes**         | Machine-readable violations  | Standardized codes for automated validation       |
| **QCReserveLedger**             | Multi-attester consensus     | Median calculation, eliminates single trust point |
| **WatchdogEnforcer**            | Permissionless enforcement   | Objective violations + 48h auto-escalation checks |

### Integration with Existing tBTC v2

The system deploys as an **independent contract suite** without modifying existing contracts:

- **Bank Authorization**: QCMinter authorized directly via `authorizedBalanceIncreasers`
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Uses same Bank/Vault/Token contracts as regular Bridge
- **Perfect Fungibility**: QC-minted tBTC indistinguishable from Bridge-minted tBTC
- **Coexistence**: Regular Bridge operations continue unchanged

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Direct Bank Integration?

- **Simplicity**: Eliminates unnecessary abstraction layers
- **Proven Infrastructure**: Leverages battle-tested Bank/Vault architecture
- **Gas Efficiency**: Direct integration reduces transaction costs
- **Reduced Risk**: Fewer contracts in the critical path

### Watchdog System Design

The watchdog system focuses on objective, measurable violations through three key solutions:

1. **Oracle Problem** (Objective Facts)

   - Solution: Multi-attester consensus via `QCReserveLedger`
   - Multiple attesters submit reserve balances, median calculation prevents manipulation

2. **Enforcement Problem** (Objective Violations)

   - Solution: Permissionless enforcement via `WatchdogEnforcer`
   - Anyone can trigger enforcement for verifiable violations

3. **Decision Problem** (Governance Actions)
   - Solution: Direct DAO action for any non-automated decisions
   - DAO monitors enforcement events and can override if needed

#### System Benefits

- **Minimal Contracts**: 3-contract architecture for clarity and efficiency
- **Machine-Readable**: Reason codes enable automated validation
- **Trust Distribution**: No single points of failure
- **Permissionless Enforcement**: Anyone can trigger objective violations
- **Gas Optimization**: Minimal state, fewer cross-contract calls

### Why Policy-Driven Architecture?

- **Upgradeability**: Business logic can evolve without core contract changes
- **Future-Proofing**: Clear upgrade path to future crypto-economic enhancements
- **Interface Stability**: Core contracts maintain stable interfaces
- **Risk Management**: Isolated upgrade risks to policy contracts only

### Why 5-State QC Model?

The 5-state model provides sophisticated QC management that balances operational flexibility with network security:

#### Network Continuity Focus
- **60% State Availability**: 3 of 5 states (Active, MintingPaused, UnderReview) allow redemption fulfillment
- **Graduated Response**: Issues handled proportionally to severity
- **Self-Recovery**: QCs can resume from self-initiated pauses without council intervention

#### Operational Excellence
- **Self-Management**: QCs can pause for maintenance using renewable credits (1 per 90 days)
- **Automated Safety**: 48-hour auto-escalation prevents indefinite self-pauses
- **Progressive Consequences**: Graduated penalties for redemption defaults avoid harsh binary outcomes

#### QC Benefits
- **Operational Autonomy**: QCs control their pause/resume cycle for routine maintenance
- **Clear Expectations**: Predictable consequences and recovery paths
- **Network Continuity**: Can fulfill redemptions even during minting pauses

#### Protocol Benefits
- **Resilient Network**: Majority of operational states preserve core user functionality
- **Reduced Manual Intervention**: Automated escalation and graduated consequences
- **Risk Distribution**: Progressive enforcement prevents sudden systemic disruption
