## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Design: Optimistic N-of-M System

**Key Innovation**: Combines optimistic execution (fast) with escalating consensus (secure)

```
Normal Operation: Primary validator submits ‚Üí 1h challenge period ‚Üí Execute
Disputed Operation: Challenges trigger ‚Üí 4h delay ‚Üí N-of-M consensus required
Critical Disputes: 3+ objections ‚Üí 12h delay ‚Üí Full consensus verification
```

**Security Model**: Legal agreements primary, T token staking supplemental

### Why This Architecture?

1. **Proven Patterns**: Leverages battle-tested optimistic-minting code
2. **Gas Efficient**: ~100k gas per attestation (within Account Control targets)
3. **Legal Framework**: Professional accountability through service agreements
4. **Progressive**: Start 3-of-5, scale to 5-of-9 over time
5. **Backward Compatible**: Zero changes to existing Account Control contracts

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Smart Contract Architecture

```solidity
// Core consensus contract
contract OptimisticWatchdogConsensus {
  struct ValidationRequest {
    bytes32 id;
    address qc;
    uint256 balance;
    uint256 timestamp;
    address primaryValidator;
    ValidationStatus status;
  }

  struct Challenge {
    bytes32 requestId;
    address challenger;
    string reason;
    uint256 timestamp;
    ChallengeStatus status;
  }

  // Optimistic execution with challenge period
  function submitAttestation(
    address qc,
    uint256 balance,
    bytes calldata proof
  ) external onlyValidator returns (bytes32 requestId);

  // Challenge mechanism
  function challengeAttestation(bytes32 requestId, string calldata reason)
    external
    onlyValidator;

  // Consensus resolution
  function resolveDispute(bytes32 requestId, bool approved)
    external
    onlyValidator;
}

```

### Validator Management

```solidity
contract WatchdogRegistry {
  struct Validator {
    address addr;
    string name;
    bool active;
    uint256 stake;
    uint256 reputation;
    bytes32 legalAgreementHash;
  }

  mapping(address => Validator) public validators;
  address[] public validatorList;

  function registerValidator(
    address validator,
    string calldata name,
    bytes32 legalAgreementHash
  ) external onlyGovernance;

  function getActiveValidators() external view returns (address[] memory);

  function getValidatorCount() external view returns (uint256);
}

```

### Integration with Account Control

```solidity
// Adapter pattern for backward compatibility
contract WatchdogAdapter {
  OptimisticWatchdogConsensus public consensus;

  // Maintains same interface as SingleWatchdog
  function submitReserveAttestation(address qc, uint256 balance) external {
    // Convert to multi-watchdog operation
    consensus.submitAttestation(qc, balance, "");
  }

  function setQCStatus(
    address qc,
    uint256 status,
    bytes32 reason
  ) external {
    // Route through consensus mechanism
    consensus.setQCStatus(qc, status, reason);
  }
}

```

## üîê Security Model

### Legal Framework

**Primary Security Mechanism**: Professional service agreements

1. **Watchdog Service Agreement**

   - Legal obligations and responsibilities
   - Performance standards and SLAs
   - Dispute resolution procedures
   - Liability and insurance requirements

2. **Compliance Requirements**
   - Identity verification (KYC)
   - Professional credentials
   - Insurance coverage
   - Bonding requirements

### Token Staking (Supplemental)

**Secondary Security Mechanism**: T token staking

1. **Staking Requirements**

   - Minimum stake: 100,000 T tokens
   - Slashing conditions: malicious behavior
   - Reward distribution: participation-based
   - Governance participation: weighted voting

2. **Incentive Alignment**
   - Validator reputation system
   - Performance-based rewards
   - Slashing for misbehavior
   - Long-term token alignment

### Dispute Resolution

**Escalation Mechanism**: Progressive consensus requirements

1. **Level 1: Optimistic Execution**

   - Single validator submission
   - 1-hour challenge period
   - Automatic execution if unchallenged

2. **Level 2: Simple Majority**

   - 2+ challenges trigger escalation
   - 4-hour consensus period
   - 3-of-5 approval required

3. **Level 3: Supermajority**
   - 3+ challenges trigger escalation
   - 12-hour consensus period
   - 5-of-7 approval required

## üìã Inclusion in Account Control Proposal

### Recommended Approach

Add a dedicated section titled **"Future Enhancement: Watchdog Decentralization"** to the main proposal:

```markdown
## 7.4 Future Enhancement: Watchdog Decentralization

While the initial Account Control implementation utilizes a single trusted Watchdog
for operational efficiency, the architecture supports future migration to a
decentralized watchdog system.

### Planned Approach: Optimistic N-of-M Consensus

The designed architecture implements:

- **Optimistic execution** with 1-hour challenge periods for routine operations
- **Escalating consensus** (3-of-5 ‚Üí 5-of-9) based on dispute levels
- **Legal agreements** as primary security mechanism
- **Backward compatibility** through adapter pattern

### Key Benefits

- **Decentralized Trust**: Removes single point of failure
- **Institutional Grade**: Professional service agreements
- **Progressive Scaling**: Start small, grow incrementally
- **Proven Patterns**: Leverages optimistic-minting architecture
```
