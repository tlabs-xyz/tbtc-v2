# Test Consolidation Progress Report

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. QCRedeemer Consolidation (9 files â†’ 3 files)

#### Files Before:
- `core-contracts/qc-redeemer.test.ts` (22 tests)
- `integration/qc-redeemer-integration.test.ts` (21 tests)
- `integration/qc-redeemer-comprehensive-integration.test.ts` (21 tests)
- `core-contracts/qc-redeemer-emergency-scenarios.test.ts` (23 tests)
- `core-contracts/qc-redeemer-error-boundaries.test.ts` (24 tests)
- `core-contracts/qc-redeemer-obligations.test.ts` (23 tests)
- `core-contracts/qc-redeemer-timeout-deadlines.test.ts` (17 tests)
- `core-contracts/qc-redeemer-trusted-fulfillment.test.ts` (20 tests)
- `core-contracts/qc-redeemer-comprehensive-demo.test.ts` (14 tests)

**Total: 185 tests across 9 files**

#### Files After:
- `core-contracts/qc-redeemer.test.ts` (unit tests - 22 tests)
- `core-contracts/qc-redeemer-edge-cases.test.ts` (consolidated edge cases - ~121 tests)
- `integration/qc-redeemer-integration.test.ts` (all integration tests - ~39 tests)

**Total: ~182 tests across 3 files (3 duplicates removed)**

### Actions Taken:
1. âœ… Removed 3 duplicate deployment tests from integration file
2. âœ… Merged comprehensive integration tests into main integration file
3. âœ… Consolidated 6 edge case files into single edge-cases file
4. âœ… Deleted original files after consolidation

## Remaining Tasks ðŸ“‹

### 1. System State Consolidation (3 â†’ 1 file)
- Merge `security/system-state-security.test.ts` into `system-management/system-state.test.ts`
- Expected to remove ~10 duplicate pause tests

### 2. QCManager Consolidation (7 â†’ 3-4 files)
- Analyze and consolidate QCManager-related test files
- Merge library tests where appropriate

### 3. Fix Failing Tests
- 2 tests failing in `qc-redeemer-integration.test.ts` after removing deployment tests
- May need to add setup code or adjust test expectations

### 4. Final Verification
- Run full test suite
- Compare coverage with baseline
- Ensure no test scenarios were lost

## Impact Summary

### Positive Changes:
- **66% reduction** in QCRedeemer test files (9 â†’ 3)
- **Clearer organization** with unit/integration/edge-cases separation
- **Easier maintenance** with consolidated edge cases in one file
- **Minimal test loss** - only 3 true duplicates removed

### Issues to Address:
- 2 failing integration tests need investigation
- Need to verify imports are correct in consolidated files
- Should run full test suite to ensure nothing broken

## Next Steps

1. Fix the 2 failing tests in qc-redeemer-integration.test.ts
2. Continue with System State consolidation
3. Analyze QCManager files for consolidation opportunities
4. Run full test suite and compare coverage
