# Account Control Test Consolidation Summary

## Quick Reference

### Current State
- **50 test files** with **1,761 tests**
- Significant duplication in QCRedeemer, SystemState, and QCManager tests
- Tests scattered across multiple files making maintenance difficult

### Target State  
- **~35 test files** with **~1,600 tests**
- Clear separation: unit tests / integration tests / edge cases
- 30% fewer files, 9% fewer duplicate tests

### Consolidation Plan

#### 1. QCRedeemer (9 → 3 files)
```
KEEP:
├── core-contracts/qc-redeemer.test.ts         # Unit tests only
├── core-contracts/qc-redeemer-edge-cases.test.ts  # All edge cases consolidated
└── integration/qc-redeemer-integration.test.ts     # All integration tests

REMOVE:
- qc-redeemer-comprehensive-integration.test.ts (merge into integration)
- qc-redeemer-comprehensive-demo.test.ts (merge into edge-cases)
- qc-redeemer-emergency-scenarios.test.ts (merge into edge-cases)
- qc-redeemer-error-boundaries.test.ts (merge into edge-cases)
- qc-redeemer-obligations.test.ts (merge into edge-cases)
- qc-redeemer-timeout-deadlines.test.ts (merge into edge-cases)
- qc-redeemer-trusted-fulfillment.test.ts (merge into edge-cases)
```

#### 2. System State (3 → 1 file)
```
KEEP:
└── system-management/system-state.test.ts  # All tests with security section

REMOVE:
- security/system-state-security.test.ts (merge security tests)
- Consider merging governance-parameters tests
```

#### 3. Bitcoin Address (No consolidation needed)
- Tests already well-organized by purpose
- Keep current structure

#### 4. QCManager (7 → 3-4 files)
- Consolidate library tests
- Merge related functionality tests
- Keep specialized scenarios separate

### Execution Steps

1. **Create baseline** - Save current test output and coverage
2. **Backup branch** - Create safety checkpoint
3. **Execute file by file** - Start with QCRedeemer
4. **Validate each step** - Run tests after each change
5. **Final verification** - Compare coverage with baseline

### Tools Available

- `TEST_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed plan with all test counts
- `CONSOLIDATION_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step checklist
- `track-test-movement.sh` - Script to track test migration

### Success Metrics

✅ All tests pass  
✅ Coverage maintained or improved  
✅ 25-30% reduction in file count  
✅ 10-15% reduction in duplicate tests  
✅ Better test organization  
✅ No test scenarios lost

### Risk Mitigation

- Backup branch created before starting
- Test after each file consolidation
- Track every test movement
- Compare final coverage with baseline
- Easy rollback if issues arise
