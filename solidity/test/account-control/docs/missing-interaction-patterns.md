# Missing QCManager Integration Patterns Analysis

## Critical Missing Interaction Patterns

### 1. QCManager ↔ QCPauseManager ↔ SystemState Triangle
**Missing Pattern**: Complete escalation workflow integration
- **Current**: Basic pause manager initialization only
- **Missing**: 
  - Self-pause initiation → pause manager escalation → system state update
  - Emergency pause trigger → cross-contract propagation → operational lockdown
  - Pause timeout expiry → automatic status recovery → system reactivation
  - Manual pause override → governance validation → state synchronization

**Test Scenarios Needed**:
```typescript
// QC self-pauses due to backing shortage
// → QCPauseManager escalates after timeout
// → SystemState disables operations
// → AccountControl freezes reserve
```

### 2. QCManager ↔ QCWalletManager ↔ QCData Integration
**Missing Pattern**: Wallet validation during operations
- **Current**: Mock wallet manager interactions
- **Missing**:
  - Wallet registration → QC status validation → operational readiness
  - Invalid wallet detection → QC status downgrade → operation blocking
  - Wallet signature verification → nonce tracking → replay protection
  - Wallet status change → QC operational impact → system adaptation

**Test Scenarios Needed**:
```typescript
// Wallet becomes invalid during operation
// → QCWalletManager flags wallet
// → QCManager updates QC status
// → Operations blocked until resolution
```

### 3. Multi-Contract Transaction Atomicity
**Missing Pattern**: Cross-contract rollback consistency
- **Current**: Individual contract success scenarios only
- **Missing**:
  - QC registration starts → AccountControl fails → QCData rollback
  - Oracle sync begins → SystemState paused → operation cancellation
  - Batch operation partial failure → consistent state across all contracts
  - Governance action mid-flight → emergency pause → transaction integrity

**Test Scenarios Needed**:
```typescript
// QC registration in progress
// → AccountControl authorization fails
// → All contract states remain consistent
// → No orphaned data exists
```

### 4. Cascading State Propagation
**Missing Pattern**: Multi-hop state change validation
- **Current**: Direct contract-to-contract validation only
- **Missing**:
  - Oracle failure → QC pause → AccountControl freeze → operation denial
  - Governance change → SystemState update → QCManager reconfiguration → operational impact
  - Emergency event → pause propagation → cross-system lockdown → recovery coordination
  - Role change → permission cascade → operational capability update

**Test Scenarios Needed**:
```typescript
// Oracle fails for extended period
// → QC automatically pauses
// → AccountControl freezes operations
// → All dependent systems correctly blocked
```

### 5. Concurrent Multi-Contract Operations
**Missing Pattern**: Race condition and conflict resolution
- **Current**: Sequential operation testing only
- **Missing**:
  - Simultaneous QC registration + oracle sync conflicts
  - Concurrent pause operations from different sources
  - Overlapping batch operations with shared resources
  - Governance actions during active operations

**Test Scenarios Needed**:
```typescript
// QC registration in progress
// + Oracle sync triggered simultaneously
// + Emergency pause activated
// → All operations resolve consistently
```

### 6. Complex Recovery Workflows
**Missing Pattern**: Multi-step failure recovery
- **Current**: Single-point failure recovery only
- **Missing**:
  - Oracle failure → fallback → oracle recovery → state resynchronization
  - QC pause → backing restoration → validation → automatic resume
  - System emergency → manual intervention → gradual reactivation → full operation
  - Contract upgrade → state migration → validation → system reactivation

**Test Scenarios Needed**:
```typescript
// System in emergency state
// → Manual backing added
// → Oracle data recovered
// → Gradual QC reactivation
// → Full operational state restored
```

## Medium Priority Missing Patterns

### 7. Event Ordering and Consistency
**Missing Pattern**: Cross-contract event sequence validation
- Events emitted in correct order across contracts
- Event data consistency between contracts
- Event-driven state update coordination

### 8. Permission and Role Cascading
**Missing Pattern**: Role change impact across system
- Role grant → permission cascade → operational impact
- Role revoke → access restriction → operation blocking
- Role modification → capability update → system adaptation

### 9. Configuration Change Propagation
**Missing Pattern**: System parameter updates across contracts
- Timeout change → operational impact → cross-contract coordination
- Threshold update → validation logic change → system-wide effect
- Parameter modification → backward compatibility → graceful transition

### 10. Resource Constraint Handling
**Missing Pattern**: System-wide resource management
- Gas limit coordination across batch operations
- Memory usage optimization in complex scenarios
- Storage constraint handling in large-scale operations

## Low Priority Missing Patterns

### 11. Administrative Operation Integration
**Missing Pattern**: Complex administrative workflows
- Multi-contract governance actions
- System-wide configuration updates
- Coordinated upgrade procedures

### 12. Monitoring and Health Check Integration
**Missing Pattern**: Cross-contract health validation
- System-wide health check coordination
- Performance monitoring across contracts
- Resource utilization tracking

### 13. Audit Trail and Compliance
**Missing Pattern**: Cross-contract audit coordination
- Operation trail consistency
- Compliance validation across contracts
- Regulatory reporting coordination

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Pattern | Business Impact | Technical Risk | Implementation Effort | Priority |
|---------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| QCPauseManager Integration | Critical | High | Medium | P0 |
| QCWalletManager Integration | High | High | Medium | P0 |
| Transaction Atomicity | Critical | Critical | High | P0 |
| Cascading State Propagation | High | High | High | P1 |
| Concurrent Operations | Medium | High | High | P1 |
| Complex Recovery | High | Medium | High | P1 |
| Event Ordering | Medium | Medium | Medium | P2 |
| Role Cascading | Medium | Low | Low | P2 |
| Configuration Propagation | Low | Low | Low | P3 |
| Resource Constraints | Low | Medium | Medium | P3 |

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Implement P0 patterns (QCPauseManager, QCWalletManager, Transaction Atomicity)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement P1 patterns (Cascading State, Concurrent Operations, Recovery)
3. **Phase 3**: Implement P2-P3 patterns based on system maturity needs

Each pattern should include:
- Positive flow testing
- Negative flow testing  
- Edge case testing
- Performance impact validation
- Security vulnerability assessment
