# V1.1 Security Fixes Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-07-15  
**Branch**: `feat/account-control-v1_1`  
**Purpose**: Address security findings from audit and implement improvements

## Priority Classification

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Fix Before Deployment)

#### 1. Fix MEV-Exploitable Validator Selection
**Finding**: FINDING_002 - Current implementation uses predictable block.number/100  
**Solution**: Implement design from watchdog-selection.md

**Implementation**:
```solidity
function calculatePrimaryValidator(
    bytes32 operationType,
    bytes calldata operationData
) public view override returns (address) {
    uint256 watchdogCount = activeWatchdogsList.length;
    require(watchdogCount > 0, "No active watchdogs");
    
    // Implement proper randomness as per watchdog-selection.md
    uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encode(
        operationType,
        operationData,
        blockhash(block.number - 1) // Use previous block hash
    )));
    
    uint256 index = seed % watchdogCount;
    return activeWatchdogsList[index];
}
```

**Todo**:
- [ ] Update calculatePrimaryValidator to use blockhash(block.number - 1)
- [ ] Add validation for blockhash availability (handle > 256 blocks case)
- [ ] Update tests to account for new selection mechanism
- [ ] Add monitoring events for primary selection

#### 2. Implement Consensus Verification for High Objections
**Finding**: FINDING_001 - Operations with high objections cannot execute  
**Solution**: Add explicit approval mechanism

**Implementation**:
```solidity
// Add to OptimisticWatchdogConsensus.sol
mapping(bytes32 => mapping(address => bool)) public operationApprovals;
mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public approvalCount;

function approveOperation(bytes32 operationId) 
    external 
    onlyActiveWatchdog 
    operationExists(operationId) 
{
    require(!operations[operationId].executed, "Already executed");
    require(!operationApprovals[operationId][msg.sender], "Already approved");
    
    operationApprovals[operationId][msg.sender] = true;
    approvalCount[operationId]++;
    
    emit OperationApproved(operationId, msg.sender, approvalCount[operationId]);
}
```

**Todo**:
- [ ] Add operationApprovals mapping
- [ ] Implement approveOperation function
- [ ] Update executeOperation to check approvals for high objection scenarios
- [ ] Add OperationApproved event
- [ ] Create tests for approval mechanism

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Should Fix)

#### 3. Add Reentrancy Protection
**Finding**: FINDING_003 - External call without reentrancy guard  
**Solution**: Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern

**Todo**:
- [ ] Import OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard
- [ ] Add nonReentrant modifier to executeOperation
- [ ] Move state changes before external calls
- [ ] Add reentrancy attack tests

#### 4. Optimize Watchdog Removal Loop
**Finding**: FINDING_004 - Unbounded loop could hit gas limit  
**Solution**: Add index mapping for O(1) removal

**Implementation**:
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public watchdogIndex;

function removeWatchdog(address watchdog, bytes32 reason) external override onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
    require(isActiveWatchdog[watchdog], "Not active watchdog");
    require(activeWatchdogsList.length > MIN_WATCHDOGS, "Below minimum");
    
    uint256 index = watchdogIndex[watchdog];
    uint256 lastIndex = activeWatchdogsList.length - 1;
    
    if (index != lastIndex) {
        address lastWatchdog = activeWatchdogsList[lastIndex];
        activeWatchdogsList[index] = lastWatchdog;
        watchdogIndex[lastWatchdog] = index;
    }
    
    activeWatchdogsList.pop();
    delete watchdogIndex[watchdog];
    isActiveWatchdog[watchdog] = false;
    
    emit WatchdogRemoved(watchdog, msg.sender, reason);
}
```

**Todo**:
- [ ] Add watchdogIndex mapping
- [ ] Update addWatchdog to maintain index
- [ ] Rewrite removeWatchdog to use index
- [ ] Update tests for new implementation

#### 5. Add Comprehensive Event Coverage
**Finding**: FINDING_005 - Missing events for direct execution  
**Solution**: Add DirectExecutionPerformed event

**Todo**:
- [ ] Add DirectExecutionPerformed event to WatchdogAdapter
- [ ] Emit event in all direct execution paths
- [ ] Add operationType parameter to event
- [ ] Update integration tests to check events

### ðŸŸ¢ Nice to Have (Post-Deployment)

#### 6. Emergency Action Timelock
**Finding**: FINDING_006 - Instant emergency override  
**Solution**: Add configurable delay

**Todo**:
- [ ] Add emergencyDelay state variable (default 24 hours)
- [ ] Add emergencyOverrideRequests mapping
- [ ] Split emergencyOverride into request/execute phases
- [ ] Add CancelEmergencyOverride function
- [ ] Create emergency timelock tests

#### 7. Strengthen Operation ID Generation
**Finding**: FINDING_007 - Predictable nonces  
**Solution**: Include msg.sender in hash

**Todo**:
- [ ] Add msg.sender to operationId calculation
- [ ] Consider adding chainId for cross-chain safety
- [ ] Update operation ID generation tests

#### 8. Input Validation for Edge Cases
**Finding**: FINDING_008 & FINDING_009  
**Solution**: Add comprehensive validation

**Todo**:
- [ ] Add bounds checking in _getEscalationLevel
- [ ] Add try-catch for SPV proof parsing
- [ ] Validate all array accesses
- [ ] Add malformed input tests

### ðŸ“‹ Watchdog Selection Update
