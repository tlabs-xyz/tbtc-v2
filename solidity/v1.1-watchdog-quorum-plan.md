# V1.1 Watchdog Quorum Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-07-15  
**Branch**: `feat/account-control-v1_1`  
**Purpose**: Implement optimistic N-of-M watchdog quorum system  
**Timeline**: 8-10 weeks

## Version Clarification

- **V1.0**: Single trusted watchdog (current implementation - 95% complete)
- **V1.1**: Optimistic N-of-M watchdog quorum (this plan)
- **V2.0**: Future enhancements (cryptographic PoR, cross-chain, etc.)

## Current Status

We've made the strategic decision to:
1. Keep V1.0 as the single watchdog implementation
2. Develop V1.1 as the watchdog quorum enhancement
3. Work on the `feat/account-control-v1_1` branch

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Interface Design (Week 1)
**Status**: âœ… Complete

1. **Create Core Interfaces**
   - [x] `IOptimisticWatchdogConsensus.sol`
   - [x] `IWatchdogOperation.sol`
   - [x] `IWatchdogRegistry.sol`

2. **Define Data Structures**
   - [x] `WatchdogOperation` struct
   - [x] `ConsensusState` struct
   - [x] Challenge and escalation types

3. **Event Definitions**
   - [x] `OperationSubmitted`
   - [x] `OperationChallenged`
   - [x] `OperationEscalated`
   - [x] `OperationExecuted`

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Weeks 2-3)
**Status**: âœ… Complete

1. **OptimisticWatchdogConsensus.sol**
   - [x] Optimistic submission logic
   - [x] Challenge mechanism
   - [x] Escalating delays
   - [x] Consensus execution

2. **WatchdogAdapter.sol**
   - [x] Implement SingleWatchdog interface
   - [x] Route to consensus system
   - [x] Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Gas Optimization**
   - [x] Target <100k for attestation
   - [x] Optimize storage layout
   - [x] Efficient data structures

### Phase 3: Supporting Contracts (Week 4)
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started

1. **WatchdogRegistry.sol** (optional)
   - [ ] Watchdog management
   - [ ] Performance tracking
   - [ ] Role assignments

2. **Integration Updates**
   - [ ] ProtocolRegistry service keys
   - [ ] Role definitions
   - [ ] Migration helpers

### Phase 4: Testing Implementation (Weeks 5-6)
**Status**: âœ… Complete

1. **Unit Tests**
   - [x] Optimistic submission
   - [x] Challenge scenarios
   - [x] Escalation logic
   - [x] Emergency procedures

2. **Integration Tests**
   - [x] Backward compatibility
   - [x] Migration scenarios
   - [x] Performance benchmarks

3. **Security Tests**
   - [x] Byzantine scenarios
   - [x] Attack vectors
   - [x] Edge cases

### Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment (Weeks 7-8)
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started

1. **Update PRDs**
   - [ ] REQUIREMENTS.md for v1.1
   - [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md for quorum
   - [ ] IMPLEMENTATION.md examples

2. **Deployment Scripts**
   - [ ] v1.1 deployment
   - [ ] Migration from v1.0
   - [ ] Role configuration

3. **Operational Docs**
   - [ ] Watchdog operator guide
   - [ ] Monitoring setup
   - [ ] Emergency procedures

## Key Design Decisions

### Optimistic Execution Model
- Primary validator submits operations optimistically
- 1-hour base challenge period
- Any watchdog can challenge with evidence
- Escalating delays: 1h â†’ 4h â†’ 12h

### Consensus Thresholds
- Start with 3-of-5 configuration
- 2 objections trigger escalation
- 3 objections require full consensus
- Progressive scaling to 5-of-9

### Backward Compatibility
- WatchdogAdapter maintains SingleWatchdog interface
- Zero changes to existing Account Control contracts
- Seamless migration path from v1.0

## Success Criteria

1. **Technical**
   - All v1.0 interfaces maintained
   - Gas targets met (<100k attestation)
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Security audit ready

2. **Operational**
   - Clear operator procedures
   - Monitoring infrastructure defined
   - Emergency procedures documented

3. **Migration**
   - Zero-downtime upgrade path
   - Rollback capability
   - State preservation

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Today**: Begin interface design
2. **This Week**: Complete interface definitions
3. **Next Week**: Start core implementation

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- Pattern adaptation complexity â†’ Start with direct copying
- Gas optimization challenges â†’ Early profiling
- Integration issues â†’ Extensive testing

### Timeline Risks
- 8-week estimate aggressive â†’ MVP first, enhance later
- Dependencies on v1.0 fixes â†’ Complete v1.0 first

## Notes

- All work on `feat/account-control-v1_1` branch
- V1.0 fixes should be completed first (1-2 days)
- Regular commits with clear v1.1 references
- Update this document as implementation progresses
