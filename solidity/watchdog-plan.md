# Watchdog Integration Finalization Plan

**Date**: 2025-07-15  
**Purpose**: Actionable plan for completing watchdog quorum integration into Account Control  
**Priority**: Technical implementation → Operations → Legal (deferred)

## Overview

This plan outlines the systematic approach to finalize the watchdog decentralization from a single watchdog to an optimistic N-of-M quorum system. The focus is on technical implementation and operational readiness, with legal framework deferred for future refinement.

## Phase 1: Current State Assessment (Week 1)

### 1.1 PRD Documentation Audit
**Goal**: Ensure all ./prd files are self-consistent and reflect the latest quorum design

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Review `REQUIREMENTS.md` for watchdog-related requirements
  - Verify all single watchdog references are updated
  - Check if quorum requirements are properly documented
  - Ensure backward compatibility requirements are clear
  
- [ ] Audit `ARCHITECTURE.md` for architectural consistency
  - Confirm optimistic N-of-M design is reflected
  - Verify integration points with Account Control
  - Check service registry patterns for upgradability
  
- [ ] Validate `IMPLEMENTATION.md` technical details
  - Review contract interfaces for completeness
  - Check deployment strategy includes migration path
  - Verify testing approach covers quorum scenarios
  
- [ ] Cross-check `watchdog-decentralization.md` with other docs
  - Ensure no contradictions with main architecture
  - Verify technical specifications align
  - Confirm implementation timeline is realistic

**Deliverables**:
- List of inconsistencies found
- Required documentation updates
- Unified technical specification

### 1.2 Optimistic-Minting Repository Analysis
**Goal**: Ensure optimistic-minting patterns align with new quorum design

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Navigate to `./optimistic-minting` directory
- [ ] Run `git status` to identify modified/relevant files
- [ ] Review key pattern files:
  - `TBTCOptimisticMinting.sol` - optimistic execution patterns
  - `RedemptionWatchtower.sol` - escalation mechanisms
  - Guardian/Minter role implementations
  
- [ ] Document patterns that need adaptation for quorum:
  - Single guardian → N-of-M consensus
  - Challenge mechanisms → Escalating delays
  - Role assignments → Deterministic selection
  
- [ ] Identify reusable components:
  - Challenge period implementations
  - Escalation delay mechanisms
  - Event structures and monitoring patterns

**Deliverables**:
- Pattern mapping document
- List of required adaptations
- Reusable component inventory

## Phase 2: Implementation Assessment (Week 2)

### 2.1 Current Contract State Analysis
**Goal**: Assess completion of watchdog-related contracts against PRD specifications

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Inventory existing watchdog contracts:
  ```bash
  find ./contracts -name "*[Ww]atchdog*" -o -name "*[Qq]uorum*"
  ```
  
- [ ] For each contract found:
  - Compare against PRD specifications
  - Check interface completeness
  - Verify event definitions
  - Assess test coverage
  
- [ ] Review integration contracts:
  - `ProtocolRegistry.sol` - service registration
  - `QCManager.sol` - watchdog integration points
  - `QCReserveLedger.sol` - attestation interfaces
  
- [ ] Analyze deployment scripts:
  - Check for watchdog deployment steps
  - Verify migration procedures
  - Assess upgrade mechanisms

**Deliverables**:
- Contract completion matrix
- Missing implementation list
- Integration gap analysis

### 2.2 Testing Infrastructure Review
**Goal**: Evaluate existing tests and identify gaps for quorum functionality

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Review existing watchdog tests:
  ```bash
  grep -r "watchdog\|Watchdog" ./test
  ```
  
- [ ] Identify missing test scenarios:
  - Optimistic attestation flow
  - Challenge and escalation
  - Byzantine behavior
  - Emergency fallback
  
- [ ] Check test utilities and fixtures:
  - Mock watchdog implementations
  - Test helper functions
  - Fixture data for quorum scenarios

**Deliverables**:
- Test coverage report
- Missing test scenarios list
- Test infrastructure requirements

## Phase 3: Gap Documentation (Week 2-3)

### 3.1 Technical Discrepancies
**Goal**: Document all technical gaps between design and implementation

**Categories to analyze**:
- [ ] **Interface Gaps**
  - Missing method signatures
  - Incomplete event definitions
  - Absent error codes
  
- [ ] **Logic Gaps**
  - Unimplemented consensus mechanisms
  - Missing challenge procedures
  - Absent escalation logic
  
- [ ] **Integration Gaps**
  - Incomplete adapter patterns
  - Missing registry updates
  - Absent migration procedures

**Format**:
```markdown
## Discrepancy: [Title]
- **Location**: [File:Line]
- **Expected**: [From PRD]
- **Actual**: [Current state]
- **Impact**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Fix**: [Proposed solution]
```

### 3.2 Operational Gaps
**Goal**: Identify missing operational components

**Areas to assess**:
- [ ] Monitoring specifications
- [ ] Alert configurations
- [ ] Runbook procedures
- [ ] Coordination protocols

- **Mitigation**: Prioritize core functionality, defer nice-to-haves

### Operational Risks
- **Risk**: Watchdog coordination complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple scenarios, add complexity gradually

## Next Immediate Actions

## Notes

- Legal framework explicitly deferred - focus on technical/operational
- Prioritize backward compatibility throughout
- Maintain gas efficiency as primary constraint
- Document everything for future maintainers
